00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,940
Why did things turn out this way?

7
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,000
I keep asking myself this question.

Again and again.

00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
I’m sorry, Chan.

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,970
…someone places the thing that I want the most in front of me,

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,770
And fool me that this thing will last forever.

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,410
Then he takes it back.

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,220
If this is the fate destined to happen to him and me,

16
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:16,210
Then who chooses this fate for us?

00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:46,770
Who is there?

21
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,150
Mr. Annop.

22
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,970
There’s someone here.

23
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,380
Mr. Annop.

24

If you have nowhere else to go,

25
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,770
you can stay with me for the meantime.

Mr. Khatha.

No matter how long time has passed.

00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:28,780
The dark power derived from Chan’s wrath still exists.

00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,770
The curse that he put on me.

35
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,000
It also still exists.

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:21,580
…if I change this land to a place for storing the cursed items.

41
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,970
What do you think about that?

42
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,370
Like a museum?

43
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,170
Are there that many items that you need to retrieve?

44
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,970
Um.

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,770
There are items that need to be gotten rid of.

46
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,770
There are items that need to be protected.

I don’t know.

Until I have the chance to apologize for what I did to Chan.

54
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:40,780
I will continue to make amends for my wrongdoings.

55
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,170
Until the day he returns.

56
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,980
Chan.

57
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,570

00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,970
Do I really have choices?

190
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,970
If I really do have choices, why it has to be me?

191
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,170
Huh?

192
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,410
Do you know…

193
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,570
Do you know how many decades I have been dwelling on it?

194
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,370
It took me more than 100 years to make up my mind and destroy his remain.

195
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,520
How could you determine my destiny like this?

196
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,370
Now you want me to kill him again?

197
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,570
Answer me.

198
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,420
Why?

199
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,180
Why it has to be me?

200
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,370
Huh?

201
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,200
Why?

202
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,600
Believe me that I understand how you are feeling.

203
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,580
Similar things like this…

204
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,600
…have happened thousands of times.

205
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,000
All humans…

206
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:41,400
…are defeated.

207
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,000
But I believe that you can do it.

208
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:47,970
Because you are created to be like me.

209
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,100
You can do everything that I can.

210
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,180
You can save every human.

211
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,610
It’s up to you whether you will do it or not.

212
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,810
Mr. Khatha.

213
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,900
Since the day that I met you,

214
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,170
I had many questions about my life.

215
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,970
I was trying to find who I am.

216
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,780
I was trying to figure out the purpose of my life.

217
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,370
It seemed that I couldn’t find any answers.

218
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,940
But today,

219
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,170
I found an answer that I learn and is very important to me.

220
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:01,170
That answer is I want to be with you.

221
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,980
I want to be with June.

222
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,370
I want to be with Triphob.

223
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,770
I want to be with Bam.

224
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:16,770
I want to be in a world where we all live together.

225
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,370
Today,

226
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,980
If you choose to continue to live here,

227
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,570
I’ll stay here with you.

228
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,970
Whatever you choose,

229
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,370
I’ll be by your side.

230
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,970
If that’s what you choose, I’ll send you back.

231
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,250
If we succeed,

232
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:57,570
We all will be together again.

233
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,970
What do I need to do next?

234
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,570
Khatha.

235
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,780
Dome.

236
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:07,170
If it’s you, you may succeed in doing what I failed to do.

237
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:14,370
I will bet my last hope on your choice.

238
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,170
[12.20 AM]

239
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,370
Hey.

240
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:22,700
You don’t need to rush and eat it up.

241
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,970
We still have some time before the world comes to an end.

242
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,980
You.

243
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,170
Are you alright?

244
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,850
I took over his body.

245
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,100
Wait.

246
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,500
Wait.

247
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,770
Where are you going?

248
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,340
June.

249
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,490
Calm down.

250
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,780
It’s me.

251
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,500
I’m Dome.

252
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,570
I took over this body from The One.

253
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,340
June, do you remember

254
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,780
the story that you told me?

255
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,170
About the ostrich.

256
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,570
They like to bury their head in the sand.

257
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:49,810
You knew that story.

258
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,200
Is this really you, Dome?

259
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,370
What are you doing here?

260
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,650
I’m looking for a skyscraper.

261
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:01,850
I need to be close to the moon as much as possible.

262
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,280
Do you have a plan?

263
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,980
No.

264
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,370
But we need to stop the moon.

265
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,770
Otherwise, everyone will be dead.

266
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,770
But.

267
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,770
The One is looking for a chance to take this body away from me through mirrors.

268
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,320
Alright.

269
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,380
I’ll protect you from The One.

270
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,570
Let’s go.

271
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:34,200
Think of this as a gift.

272
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,180
One day when I am gone,

273
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:39,570
Keep this as a reminder of me.

274
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,920
I promise you.

275
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,780
No matter what happens, I will protect you,

276
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,450
I will be by your side,

277
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:55,910
I will never leave you,

278
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,770
and I will never let you be in danger.

279
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,570
Antika.

280
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,170
A faithful follower of God.

281
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,580
I want to know…

282
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,970
honestly…

283
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,570
what you believe in.

284
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,830
What did you see that day?

285
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,970
I…

286
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,370
I thought that was God.

287
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:42,080
I thought he was communicating with me,

288
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,100
Telling me that he chose me to be his reviver.

289
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,580
Until now,

290
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:58,780
Deep down, you are still searching for the answer to what you saw that day.

291
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,570
Do you still believe in God, Antika?

292
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,600
Yes.

293
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,120
I still believe in God.

294
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,450
Why don’t you sacrifice your life for God?

295
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,010
You don’t have faith.

296
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:16,770
God will never choose you.

297
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,650
To welcome the return of the Lord from ashes,

298
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:25,180
Surrender the purest of souls.

299
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,770
What are you doing?

300
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,370
You are not my God.

301
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,570
Get up, Chan.

302
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,850
You need to learn this.

303
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,870
If you don’t have any fighting skills,

304
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,770
You will be a target of bullying.

305
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,380
Come on.

306
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,980
If I fight with you, I always lose.

307
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,770
Come on. Get up.

308
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,170
Alright.

309
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,980
I won’t force you to learn it.

310
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,180
From now on,

311
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,210
I will protect you.

312
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:23,910
I will take care of you.

313
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,910
I won’t let anyone harm you.

314
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,770
I promise.

315
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:34,780
I’m glad that you are still alive.

316
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,380
You came back to life.

317
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,970
I guess it’s not because of my curse, isn’t it?

318
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,970
I came back to life.

319
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,780
Because I have something I need to do.

320
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,170
You came to get rid of me

321
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,000
with that poisonous dagger, right?

322
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
I won’t make the same mistake again.

323
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,580
Let’s work things out together, Chan.

324
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,180
What I said will never change.

325
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,970
I will destroy everything that you have.

326
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,920
Or more than you have.

327
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,100
Why, Chan?

328
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,370
Can’t we work things out together?

329
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,580
No.

330
00:33:58,620 --> 00:33:59,970
Because it already started.

331
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:03,570
If you want to stop it, you need to kill me.

332
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,620
Stop it, Chan.

333
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,200
I don’t want to fight with you.

334
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,200
I don’t want to hurt you.

335
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,180
Fight me.

336
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,820
Why don’t you fight against me?

337
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,780
If you don’t do that, you will lose everything.

338
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,380
You said you would protect and take care of them.

339
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:28,460
If you don’t get up and fight,

340
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,170
You won’t be able to do what you said.

341
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,050
Let’s end it here.

342
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,170
Why do we have to end up like this?

343
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:18,600
Because this is our destiny.

344
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,770
It finally ends.

345
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,260
Chan.

346
00:35:59,160 --> 00:35:59,980
Chan.

347
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:05,980
Chan.

348
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,370
Chan.

349
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,570
Get up, Chan.

350
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,490
Chan.

351
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,970
When it comes to fighting skills, I lost to you.

352
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,780
Don’t act like you are breaking your promise.

353
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:33,570
I don’t want it to end this way.

354
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,570
I want us to live together like we used to.

355
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,170
Khatha.

356
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,770
Do you know?

357
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,580
I was always with you.

358
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,170
I’d never left you.

359
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,410
I had been watching you.

360
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,580
I saw you…

361
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:07,170
…no longer being alone.

362
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:15,570
I want you…

363
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,180
to live,

364
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:25,180
to have a happy life with your friends.

365
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,970
Khatha.

366
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:48,710
I’m setting you free.

367
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,980
There will no longer be an obligation,

368
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,370
a curse,

369
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,170
or a promise binding us together.

370
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,200
Now, you can choose your own life.

371
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,770
The moon tonight,

372
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,380
It’s not as pretty as the one we saw that night.

373
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,780
If we have another chance to lie down and watch the moon together,

374
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,370
That would be great.

375
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,980
Wouldn’t it?

376
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:57,570
Chan.

377
00:38:59,210 --> 00:38:59,980
Chan.

378
00:39:26,250 --> 00:39:27,570
Do you have a plan for how to stop it?

379
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,970
Then what the hell are we doing here?

380
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,770
If we are going to get rid of these terrestrial rocks,

381
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,410
We need to use the terrestrial rock that we have.

382
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,170
Huh?

383
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:50,380
Dome.

384
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,570
You need to focus.

385
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:55,170
Go to the museum and bring the terrestrial rock here.

386
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,370
Stop!

387
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,170
You did it, Dome.

388
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,770
There are more of them.

389
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,770
We are not the only ones who are fighting with this.

390
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,370
It’s so beautiful.

391
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,880
Mr. Khatha.

392
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:33,570
How is Mr. Dome?

393
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,400
He’s fine.

394
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:37,830
You don’t need to worry about us.

395
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,400
You should go take care of Bam.

396
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:44,370
Yes.

397
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,780
I’ll see you at the museum.

398
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,960
I…

399
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,250
In exchange for Bam’s life,

400
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:00,650
I...

401
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,770
I’ll trade this.

402
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:35,970
Hey!

403
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:39,000
Dome and I are heading back to the museum.

404
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,970
Hello, Mr. Khatha.

405
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,000
I’m Dome.

406
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,970
I stole this body from The One.

407
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:51,000
I’m not used to seeing you in this body.

408
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,970
See you at the museum.

409
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:57,570
Let’s go.

410
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,300
You are still a fool, Khatha.

411
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,780
I thought you would be dead.

412
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,410
Can’t we talk nicely?

413
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,410
What do you want?

414
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:13,850
Where is Dome?

415
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,500
Calm down.

416
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:21,000
Let’s talk one thing at a time.

417
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,980
Did he tell you about it?

418
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,020
About the test that God gives to every human.

419
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:29,970
Do you know what?

420
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,380
Who tests God?

421
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,370
What do you mean?

422
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,180
I am like you.

423
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:49,180
I’m a story written in a book.

424
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,780
to tell about the beginning

425
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:55,800
and the end…

426
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,780
…of everything in the universe.

427
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:12,600
Have you ever heard about the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse in the bible?

428
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:25,800
I am one of them.

429
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:29,980
I am one of the Four Horsemen.

430
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:34,780
We are sent to end every life in the world.

431
00:47:36,350 --> 00:47:37,180
Plague.

432
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,200
War.

433
00:47:41,970 --> 00:47:43,700
Famine.

434
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,770
and…

435
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,940
Death.

436
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:56,370
But I’m not from the bible known in your world.

437
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,650
My existence is real…

438
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,380
…in another world.

439
00:48:04,370 --> 00:48:05,970
The four of us.

440
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,870
We went to different worlds.

441
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,780
Until one day.

442
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,170
Until one day,

443
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:24,570
when my God died.

444
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,770
My world also came to an end.

445
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,570
When my world came to an end,

446
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,180
Everything lost its balance.

447
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:52,790
Other worlds including the world that you are living in.

448
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:53,970
They will crumble down.

449
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:00,650
That’s the reason why I came here.

450
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,200
I came here to look for a new God.

451
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:07,170
You.

452
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,980
You are an important competitor in my game.

453
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,020
How did your God die?

454
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,180
I killed Him.

455
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,490
I had to kill Him.

456
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:37,890
Don’t look at me like that.

457
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:39,990
You don’t know how cruel He was.

458
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:41,980
The reason that you met Chan and Chan was killed.

459
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:45,570
They were His plan.

460
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,770
What He did was…

461
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:01,170
…taking the things that humans wanted the most.

462
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,970
Then put them

463
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,180
In front of the humans.

464
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,970
He would lure these humans…

465
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:21,570
…to select the things that would eventually hurt them.

466
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:26,380
Everyone says we have choices.

467
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,410
In fact, we have no choice.

468
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:35,970
We would have no choice,

469
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,370
If He was still alive.

470
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,570
Are you saying…

471
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:47,970
…you killed God

472
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:52,340
…because you want humans to have choices?

473
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,980
Bingo.

474
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,580
Otherwise,

475
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,570
we would have to walk on the path that He wrote.

476
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,980
We couldn’t change it.

477
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:13,170
There wouldn’t have been a second chance.

478
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,970
For us to amend our mistakes.

479
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,720
Where is Dome?

480
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:39,040
Stop looking for him.

481
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:41,980
That boy.

482
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,400
He is just another cursed item for you.

483
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,010
Because Dome interrupted the plan.

484
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:55,880
This test is a failure.

485
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,370
Dome is sent to a new test.

486
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,320
Khatha.

487
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:46,770
Khatha.

488
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:51,570
The road ahead of you,

489
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,980
It is long.

490
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,580
Your life.

491
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,210
It’s like a pawn in a big game.

492
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,170
This…

493
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:10,780
…could be our last game.

494
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:14,910
If you choose to continue to play,

495
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,570
You will meet many people who are just like you.

496
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:26,570
And I…

497
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:27,910
What are you saying? I don’t understand it.

498
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,200
No matter how hard we try to resist our destiny.

499
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:42,500
Even though we choose a different path.

500
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:48,690
There will be people who are hurt and killed because of it anyway.

501
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,970
The test will never end.

502
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,200
Until we find the chosen one.

503
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:04,200
Someone who can change the human fate that is predestined.

504
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,570
I hope that person will be you.

505
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:15,570
You will get to sit at the highest point.

506
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,980
Use your power…

507
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:20,380
to give everyone in the world…

508
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:22,770
the freedom…

509
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,580
to write their own story.

510
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:29,980
Khatha.

511
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,970
I put a cursed item in front of you.

512
00:54:37,630 --> 00:54:39,000
But I won’t force you.

513
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,170
It’s up to you

514
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,400
whether you will pick it up.

515
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:50,380
In exchange for the freedom of everyone in the world,

516
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:53,970
you need to follow the path I laid for you.

517
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,570
Don’t follow the path laid by the previous God.

518
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,170
Don’t fall into traps.

519
00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:03,900
Don’t search for Dome.

520
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:28,780
You already had a choice in mind.

521
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:35,980
Why are you the same old fool?

522
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,780
Am I wrong that I put my hope on you?

523
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:50,370
I will choose neither the path you laid for me,

524
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:55,180
nor the path laid by the previous God.

525
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,770
I will choose my own path.

526
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,100
I have to leave now.

527
00:56:10,850 --> 00:56:13,780
I’m sorry for causing a lot of chaos.

528
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,100
It’s my style.

529
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:22,770
Good luck with the path that you chose.

530
00:56:24,430 --> 00:56:26,370
We will meet again one day.

531
00:57:10,770 --> 00:57:11,970
Mr. Khatha.

532
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:13,170
It’s time.

533
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,170
I’ll be right there.

534
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,780
Mom.

535
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,770
Who is the man in the photo with me?

536
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,000
He’s Triphob, your best friend from your childhood.

537
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:58,780
Do you remember him?

538
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,100
I’m here to pick up the flower that I ordered.

539
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,300
Here it is.

540
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,180
It’s lily of the valley.

541
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:21,000
It has a good meaning.

542
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,570
Are you waiting for the return of your special someone?

543
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,700
How is he doing?

544
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,570
The same.

545
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:12,510
There’s no sign that he will wake up.

546
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,570
Are you going to take on a journey to look for Dome?

547
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,380
I will take on a journey as well.

548
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,770
I plan to write a book.

549
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,370
I hope that in the end…

550
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,980
we all will get to be together again.

551
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,170
Tum has already left on a journey.

552
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:22,260
He wrote that he decided to give it another try.

553
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:25,800
even though

554
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,970
he may fail to change the result.

555
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,200
Let’s say you were not drunk.

556
01:01:36,110 --> 01:01:37,180
I was the drunk one

557
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:40,110
I was drunk on love.

558
01:01:40,110 --> 01:01:41,980
If I don’t do anything,

559
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:44,380
I will regret it for the rest of my life.

560
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,600
You know I like you.

561
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,500
If you like me too, why don’t you agree to be my boyfriend?

562
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,100
I’m tired of putting moves on you.

563
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,210
Sure.

564
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,610
Let’s date.

565
01:02:21,990 --> 01:02:22,940
Really?

566
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:23,970
Yes.

567
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:27,580
Are you serious?

568
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,100
You don’t want it.

569
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:30,800
Of course.

570
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:39,580
Mr. Khatha, I believe we can change it.

571
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:44,380
Do you know I’ve been waiting for this for so long?

572
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,570
I know.

573
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,510
We don’t have to be God.

574
01:02:49,050 --> 01:02:50,700
We can be just humans.

575
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,770
It looks like Mr. Tum has turned on the machine

576
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:01,800
and set the coordinates for you.

577
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:11,320
Here.

578
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,300
While you are away,

579
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:25,170
I’ll take care of the museum.

580
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:41,460
Please take care of the museum.

581
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:01,180
(During my long life,)

582
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:04,250
(I keep asking myself.)

583
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:09,040
(Why people are seduced by greed?)

584
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:13,180
(Why are they addicted to the things that will hurt them in the end?)

585
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:20,190
(Someone is willing to sacrifice everything to have these items in their possession.)

586
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,770
(It’s not because they don’t have a choice.)

587
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,380
(But these items give them hope.)

588
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:33,570
(The hope that the missing piece in their life will be fulfilled.)

589
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:35,980
(They receive a test forcing them to choose.)

590
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,370
(They have no clue what kind of result is waiting for them.)

591
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:40,770
(Just like me.)

592
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:43,170
(I chose to take on a journey.)

593
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:47,430
(To look for my missing piece.)

594
01:04:49,010 --> 01:04:50,380
(I chose to leave on a journey.)

595
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:53,970
(Not because I’m going to play in God’s game.)

596
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:57,580
(But because someone is waiting for me.)

597
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,780
(Tum told me.)

598
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:16,780
(He believes in the marvel of science more than a myth about God.)

599
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:21,570
(While the bible said the earth was flat,)

600
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:25,170
(A scientist proved that the earth is round.)

601
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:28,770
(Maybe God is not always right.)

602
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:33,570
(We may be able to overcome the path that is predestined for us.)

603
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:35,970
(If we have faith.)

604
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:39,570
(We need to have faith in the path that we choose.)

605
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,370
(One day, we will find happiness)

606
01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:47,100
(on the path that we choose for ourselves.)

607
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:15,000
I finally found you.

608
01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:17,400
Mr. Khatha.

609
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,780
Let’s get out of here.

Midnight Museum: The Magician’s Embodiment

618
01:07:59,540 --> 01:08:02,380
The situation is under control.

619
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,400
The suspects are taken to the police station for questioning.

620
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,370
Stop.

621
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:19,700
Hey.

622
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,570
Do you hear me?
