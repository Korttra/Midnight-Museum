1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,660
If I can control it,

2
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:04,780
I can use it to open the door to another universe to bring Dome back.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,360
Tum.

4
00:00:07,385 --> 00:00:08,745
Did Dome come back?

5
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:09,865
Dome.

6
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:11,250
Help me.

7
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,590
I'm in here.

8
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,590
Help me.

9
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,380
(I believe many people have questions regarding God,)

10
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,780
(whether He truly exists.)

11
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:27,580
But God promised us through His prophet

12
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,970
that He shall return.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,760
He shall return when the sun...

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,780
...turns into darkness...

15
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,210
(It's been days and they're still missing. #MissingTeens)

16
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,950
The moon into blood...

17
00:00:39,975 --> 00:00:41,039
(I miss you. Come home soon. #MissingTeens)

18
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:45,650
And the stars into rubble raining down upon earth.

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,090
(#MissingTeens)

20
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,168
Before the coming of...

21
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:50,917
(Another victim of #MissingTeens, Aom, who disappears after school)

22
00:00:50,942 --> 00:00:54,137
...the great and terrible day of the Lord.

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,400
Dear Lord, have mercy.

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,250
Dear Lord, have mercy.

25
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,540
- O devout believers,
- O devout believers,

26
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,895
- believe and have faith.
- believe and have faith.

27
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,980
Have faith in the Prophet.

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:21,610
Have faith in God.

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,890
You said you wanted to play music to welcome the coming of God

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,450
How could someone who lacks faith in what she worships

31
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,410
play hymns to God?

32
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,080
It's just hard to believe that...

33
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,285
That God would return in the form of a corpse?

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,170
How does God matter to you?

35
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,810
To me,

36
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,210
it doesn't matter who God is.

37
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,100
I simply don't care.

38
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,520
I just believe that

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,040
I can play those hymns better than anyone here.

40
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,970
And I am here to fulfill that duty,

41
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,910
just as Miss Ratchanee told me to.

42
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,200
Don't you know who Ratchanee truly is?

43
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,570
I can't let a faithless child like you handle such an important job.

44
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,970
But someone who doubts God like you...

45
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,000
can?

46
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,410
You've lost faith in that lifeless form, too.

47
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,140
Get out.

48
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,010
(I bestow upon you this gift as praise for your resolution.)

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,400
(It is not a crime for humans to seek attention from others or from God.)

50
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,770
(But all earthly desires often come with a price.)

51
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,570
(I expect you know the story of a poor musician,)

52
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,080
(who devoted his whole life to music,)

53
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,610
(but no matter how hard he tried,)

54
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:12,010
(his notes never reached a single soul.)

55
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,400
(Until one day, he came upon a crossroad.)

56
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,780
(He had to choose between turning his back on what he loved, accepting defeat,)

57
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,010
(or surrender everything and make a bargain to achieve what he believed in.)

58
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,370
(What about you?)

59
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,180
(Will you bargain everything you have for what you desire?)

60
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,480
I will bargain.

61
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,610
Tor Thanaphob

00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,770

Directed by Attaporn Theemakorn

68
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,170
Help!

69
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,210
Help!

70
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,770
Mr. Khatha.

71
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:55,830
June.

72
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,580
Can anyone hear me?

73
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Help!

74
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,260
I just started hearing Dome asking for help from inside the mirror.

75
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,170
You can hear him?

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,770
I think I'm the only one who does.

77
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,830
What's going on?

78
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,000
Why is Dome stuck in there?

79
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,460
It's possible that Mr. Dome got out of the Limbo.

80
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,570
But without a vessel,

81
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,570
he got out of there as a...

82
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,170
As a wavelength.

83
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,570
So he needs a medium that reflects his image.

84
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,780
Are you sure about this?

85
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,170
Not at all.

86
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,610
That means what we need to prioritize right now is to find Dome's body?

87
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,970
Where the hell have you gone, Triphob?

88
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,180
Mr. Khatha.

89
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,990
Triphob.

90
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,570
What happened?

91
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,370
I was attacked by one of the cult members.

92
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,570
Does that mean I was in the car with someone else?

93
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,980
Yes, Mr. Tum.

94
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,370
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,980
I thought you went with Bam.

96
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,755
Hello?

97
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
Bam?

98
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,830
Where are you?

99
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,170
That's my question.

100
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,570
What are you doing here at the cult's headquarters?

101
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,180
What are you talking about?

102
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,820
I saw you walk right into The Eternity.

103
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,200
I followed you, but you disappeared.

104
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,220
That wasn't me.

105
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,370
I'm with Mr. Khatha at the museum.

106
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,170
How can I be sure I'm talking to the real Phob?

107
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,450
Bam.

108
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,580
Let's give us a shot.

109
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,170
What the hell are you babbling?

110
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,170
That's what I was going to say to you.

111
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,770
After everything is over...

112
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,770
Once all this is over,

113
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,450
let's give dating a shot.

114
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:49,800
You're really... the worst.

115
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,770
Is there no better way of proving you really are you?

116
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,380
Who says this kind of stuff on the phone?

117
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,180
Hey, Phob.

118
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,570
You're with everyone at the museum, right?

119
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,490
Put me on speaker.

120
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,800
I saw Dome here.

121
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,770
Whoever wore Triphob's face took Dome here.

122
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,310
Phob.

123
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,400
Do you remember the missing teen cases I was telling you about?

124
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,370
I think the kids are all here.

125
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,620
I need to know what they're planning with this.

126
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,620
Bam.

127
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,170
Don't be stubborn.

128
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,570
Get out of there. It's too dangerous.

129
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:35,970
Sorry, Phob.

130
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,370
This case is important to me, too.

131
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,730
I have to go.

132
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,730
See you.

133
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:43,330
Bam.

134
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,580
Bam. Bam.

135
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,370
We need to go to her.

136
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,030
Tum.

137
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,850
Stay here and fix that damn machine.

138
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:57,370
We'll be back with Dome's body.

139
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,370
Yes.

140
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,980
Wait.

141
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,780
This Bible belongs to Antika.

142
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,770
By standard, the Bible is a collection of different texts.

143
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,750
Each sect has their own version,

144
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,770
but none is as thick as this one used by The Eternity.

145
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,770
The content of this book is almost entirely modified and rewritten.

146
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,750
Not to mention there are strange rituals and magic spells.

147
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,050
It got me thinking that this book is just like...

148
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,780
The Codex Gigas.

149
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,370
What is that?

150
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,595
It's a version of the Bible said to be written from the Devil's account.

151
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:51,680
What I'm more concerned about is the fact

152
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,760
that Bam said the missing teens are there.

153
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,530
Gather devout believers,

154
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:03,570
sing the songs of praises,

155
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:05,900
surrender the purest of souls...

156
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,040
All to welcome the return of the Lord from ashes.

157
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,300
I think...

158
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,980
They're going to sacrifice those children

159
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,770
to resurrect whatever they believe is their God.

160
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,370
I'm afraid we do not allow video recording.

161
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,370
What is your business here, officer?

162
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,770
Why did you lure these children here?

163
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,050
"Lure"?

164
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,930
As far as I'm concerned, everyone is here of their own free will.

165
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,314
Well, then.

166
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,770
Why did you kidnap Dome here?

167
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,370
What do you mean?

168
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,770
Are you saying the Lord's body is here?

169
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:07,272
"The Lord"?

170
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,104
What are you saying?

171
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,990
Spit it out.

172
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,497
Where is Dome?

173
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:35,731
What do you think you're doing?

174
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,670
No.

175
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:39,499
It's not me.

176
00:12:43,323 --> 00:12:44,323
Stop this.

177
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,070
Hey.

178
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,771
Don't.

179
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,396
Don't!

180
00:13:09,967 --> 00:13:11,099
You.

181
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,388
Your service is no longer required.

182
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,427
Surprised, aren't you?

183
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,370
Surprised that I am now the praise singer of the Lord?

184
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,470
Get her.

185
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,810
Find her.

186
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,980
Why has it gotta be us doing this?

187
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,980
It's an order so just do it.

188
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,770
Do you want to be locked up like those who resisted?

189
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,706
My Lord...

190
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,380
Allow me to be the one to resurrect you, my Lord.

191
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,970
Let's look for another way in.

192
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,980
June.

193
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,400
I sense something odd.

194
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,800
Me, too.

195
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,540
Watch out!

196
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Triphob?

197
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,160
- No!
- June!

198
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,580
Dome.

199
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,259
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

200
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,420
Yes.

201
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,740
It's like...

202
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,780
They're forced to show their deepest instinctive emotions.

203
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,521
Could it be...

204
00:17:22,243 --> 00:17:23,893
Keep an eye on Khatha and Triphob.

205
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,148
I'll be right back.

206
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,770
Don't interrupt my piano session.

207
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,900
It's....

208
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,830
It's the original manuscript of that book.

209
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,300
Stop.

210
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,780
May the power of my faith be with me.

211
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,850
Allow me to be the one to resurrect you.

212
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,970
Let this be the testimony to all who question my faith

213
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,570
and the evidence to my own self.

214
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,970
Why won't you wake up?

215
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:50,890
Why?

216
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,970
Why won't you wake up?

217
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,570
Why won't you wake up?

218
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,420
Why won't you...

219
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:00,900
Why?

220
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,370
Why?

221
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,530
Hey!

222
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,170
Hey!

223
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,176
What are you doing to my body?

224
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:28,001
Why am I here?

225
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,600
Hey.

226
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,190
Give me back my body.

227
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,000
As proof of my faith,

228
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,370
to deserve to hear the your utterances,

229
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,770
I am willing to surrender.

230
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,580
What are you doing?

231
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,370
Why are you doing this?

232
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,210
I can hear you now.

233
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,060
I can hear you now.

234
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,000
My Lord.

235
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,980
I can hear you now.

236
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,370
What do you want from me?

237
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,853
Let me be by your side when Judgement Day comes.

238
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,250
Judgement Day?

239
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Yes, my Lord.

240
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,580
Allow me to be the only one by my God's side.

241
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,050
I...

242
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,570
I am no God.

243
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,720
You are.

244
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,570
You are God.

245
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,250
You showed me your power.

246
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,490
I said stop!

247
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,170
Even though your power was impure that day.

248
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,970
Please allow me to follow you and be the one to resurrect you to your body.

249
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,370
What?

250
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,660
Does it never occur to you that

251
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,110
everything that you believe in

252
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,570
is just your misunderstanding?

253
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:29,970
No...

254
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,370
It is not.

255
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,770
I have my proof.

256
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,880
It is all true.

257
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,380
Does it never occur to you that

258
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,630
you've received some false information?

259
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,970
No.

260
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,370
Everything has been destined from the beginning.

261
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,430
No way.

262
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,850
I did all the right things.

263
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,380
Does it never occur to you for a second that what you're doing is wrong?

264
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,380
No.

265
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,980
That's not true.

266
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,240
No...

267
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:57,580
It's not true!

268
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:09,570
(I've been telling you that man is the Devil.)

269
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,010
Yet you believed what the Devil showed you.

270
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,370
If you are so sure he is no God,

271
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,452
why didn't you get him out of the way from the very beginning?

272
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,553
Was it not because you doubted it, too?

273
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,970
I knew you tried to test him so many times before.

274
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,350
It seems you have turned evidently delusional.

275
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,170
Just stay there and wait for Judgement to come,

276
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:52,770
my once beloved granddaughter.

277
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,780
He's just a child.

278
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,300
Bam.

279
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,210
Bam, it's me.

280
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,210
Bam.

281
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,370
Bam, it's just me.

282
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,810
Bam, it's me!

283
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:29,450
Bam!

284
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,050
Bam, stop it.

285
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,050
Focus.

286
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:42,310
Bam, Focus.

287
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,970
Bam.

288
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,580
Bam.

289
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,380
Wake up.

290
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,370
Bam.

291
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Bam.

292
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,370
I said it's time to wake up.

293
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,180
Bam, wake up, please.

294
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,770
Wake up.

295
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,770
Bam.

296
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,260
It is I...

297
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,640
The praise singer of the Lord.

298
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,580
I hereby commence the Lord's resurrection

299
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,170
from right this moment.

300
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,380
Let me go!

301
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:24,600
Let go!

302
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,280
Judgement has arrived.

303
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,970
I shall show wonders

304
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:20,370
in heavens

305
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,690
and earth.

306
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:25,170
I have gathered devout believers,

307
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,260
chant hymns,

308
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,610
and surrender their pure souls

309
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,770
to welcome the Lord's return from the ashes.

310
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,700
Drink the blood

311
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,770
to celebrate the coming of the Lord.

312
00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:47,370
Those who devote themselves to God

313
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,370
shall be chosen as survivors

314
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:53,500
in the impending new world.

315
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,200
O devout believers,

316
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,430
surrender your emotions,

317
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:07,170
surrender your life,

318
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,000
surrender your soul

319
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,300
to the moon,

320
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:14,370
the purest energy absorbent.

321
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,970
And when the ritual is over,

322
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,370
all of us

323
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,970
shall be one with God...

324
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,210
for all eternity.

325
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,580
June, wait.

326
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:19,170
I need your help.

327
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,370
(You shall resurrect God.)

328
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,570
You shall doubtlessly believe in the Gospel.

329
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,570
(Antika)

330
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,480
When a fireball flies across the sky,

331
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,970
that shall be your sign.

332
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,230
If you are not God,

333
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,170
then why?

334
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,770
Why?

335
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,170
Why?

336
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,840
Get up.

337
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,090
Come with me.

338
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,400
Get up.

339
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,570
What's happened to you?

340
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:26,370
I've lost all my power.

341
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:30,536
I've lost all my faith.

342
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,317
Are you saying you can't get up

343
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:38,661
because you don't have faith?

344
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,570
What would an object like you understand about a human's faith?

345
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,800
You don't have the least idea how powerful faith can be.

346
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,550
Take that girl, for example.

347
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,970
She never had faith before,

348
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,570
but once she does, she's become so powerful.

349
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,970
I'd love to understand you, Antika.

350
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,770
I'd really love to understand your faith.

351
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,410
But I think someone is abusing your faith for their own gains.

352
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,970
I've read the scripture and I found this.

353
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,780
Tell me what this picture means.

354
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:40,770
That is the image of God.

355
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:46,770
My grandfather wrote this scripture out of his devotion.

356
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,970
When he was dying,

357
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,970
he said he met God.

358
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,610
God told him everything

359
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:09,570
and he wrote it down in this book.

360
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,840
God?

361
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:20,900
Yes.

362
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,170
Antika, the book you believe in may resemble the Bible,

363
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,511
but it isn't it.

364
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,585
Some parts were rewritten

365
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:34,670
and something is completely missing.

366
00:33:34,695 --> 00:33:36,315
Something like...

367
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,370
The story of the King of Tyre.

368
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,970
I've never heard of it.

369
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,970
In the Bible, the King of Tyre claimed himself to be God.

370
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,527
His arrogance and maleficence were said to come from a possession.

371
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,511
I believe someone's claimed to be God

372
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:58,875
and taken power from your devotion.

373
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,800
And now they're using that power to do whatever they want.

374
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,980
Everything I did...

375
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,570
You shall resurrect God.

376
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,010
(You shall doubtlessly believe in the Gospel.)

377
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,980
Grandfather lied to me.

378
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,770
What does he want?

379
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,900
I don't know.

380
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,980
But I think you can fix this.

381
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,570
And I know

382
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,180
how you can get your power back.

383
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:44,370
My power may not originate from faith.

384
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,970
For me...

385
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,770
It's pure rage.

386
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,250
Let's go.

387
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,380
The One.

388
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,780
You go save Dome.

389
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,610
I'll handle this.

390
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,170
I will bargain.

391
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,170
Boon!

392
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,180
How...

393
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,300
How have you stayed alive until now?

394
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,580
Faith.

395
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:46,100
A traitor like you would never understand.

396
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:52,184
You can never atone for what you did, Khatha.

397
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:56,370
That was why he cursed you to a life

398
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,180
of endless suffering.

399
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,170
As if you're any different.

400
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,820
You are in no better state.

401
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,970
This is a test.

402
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,970
No matter how trying and torturing He tests me,

403
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:15,570
I shall stay by The Magician's side.

404
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,570
What about you, Khatha?

405
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,370
His body has been with you this entire time,

406
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:29,970
but you never even think of doing anything for Him.

407
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,510
Is that how you show your love and dedication?

408
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:39,570
I can't let Chan come back to life.

409
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,170
If he does, he will destroy everything.

410
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,370
Then destroy His body.

411
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:54,640
If you fear so much that His return will obliterate this world,

412
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,210
take a step ahead and destroy His vessel.

413
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,170
Can you do it?

414
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,770
You're afraid.

415
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,570
So you are.

416
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:21,010
You can't destroy it,

417
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:25,770
but keeping it around makes you look over your shoulder with caution.

418
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:33,570
So the real curse is an endless suffering of your very own thoughts.

419
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,450
In due time,

420
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:53,970
He shall return to judge you and this earth.

421
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,380
Be sure to watch the world's last moment

422
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,400
and drown in the feelings he left you with,

423
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,700
Khatha.

424
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:33,000
Do you think God will accept you for this, Antika?

425
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:35,970
I no longer believe in any God.

426
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,570
The only thing I'll put my faith in from now on

427
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,400
is me.

428
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,170
Fool.

429
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:19,179
You should do what you should have done a long time ago, Khatha.

430
00:43:25,294 --> 00:43:26,906
Don't worry about Dome's body.

431
00:43:27,472 --> 00:43:28,779
I'll look after it.

432
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,779
(I have something for you.)

433
00:43:47,931 --> 00:43:49,179
Check this out.

434
00:44:14,257 --> 00:44:15,580
It's a gift.

435
00:44:17,377 --> 00:44:21,577
I'm glad I met you here.

436
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,179
One day, when I'm gone,

437
00:44:26,031 --> 00:44:27,582
keep this with you as a memento of me.

438
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:25,179
(You and I will never part.)

439
00:45:25,398 --> 00:45:27,579
(We will always be brothers.)

440
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:11,275
(I promise you this.)

441
00:46:12,472 --> 00:46:14,379
No matter what happens,

442
00:46:14,674 --> 00:46:16,714
I will protect you,

443
00:46:16,714 --> 00:46:17,979
stay with you,

444
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:19,804
never abandon you,

445
00:46:20,773 --> 00:46:22,779
and I will never put you in harm's way.

446
00:46:24,162 --> 00:46:25,179
Chan.

447
00:46:30,485 --> 00:46:32,379
I am sorry.

450
00:48:21,022 --> 00:48:23,896
If all of this was his fate and mine,

451
00:48:23,896 --> 00:48:25,102
then who...

452
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:26,715
Can't we just play nice?

453
00:48:26,894 --> 00:48:28,311
I will bargain.

454
00:48:28,311 --> 00:48:29,678
If I don't do something,

455
00:48:29,678 --> 00:48:31,183
I know I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

456
00:48:31,183 --> 00:48:32,567
You are not my God.

457
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,779
...who destined us to go through this?

458
00:48:34,934 --> 00:48:35,982
Long time no see.

459
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,260
Chan.
