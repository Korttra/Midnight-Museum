1
00:00:25,695 --> 00:00:27,675
We are not yet open.

2
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,255
Is this the museum that has cursed artifacts?

3
00:00:36,433 --> 00:00:37,433
Help me.

4
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,261
This typewriter...

5
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,276
It's typing by itself.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,062
Yes.

7
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,007
You're at the right place.

8
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,877
This is the place

9
00:00:48,902 --> 00:00:51,459
where cursed artifacts from all over the world are kept.

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,070
Objects with stories,

11
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,720
myths,

12
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:58,655
or feelings behind it.

13
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:07,970
Welcome to Midnight Museum.

14
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,195
It's doing it again.

15
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,210
Take it. Just take it.

16
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,565
I'm out of here.

24
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,810
Hey, you little shits.

25
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:28,345
Get your filthy hands off my freaking motorcycle.

26
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,065
If you want it so bad,

27
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,145
beg your mother to buy one for you.

28
00:02:32,675 --> 00:02:33,699
Go away.

29
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:42,670
Jib.

30
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:44,066
Shut it.

31
00:02:44,325 --> 00:02:45,621
Just take care of him.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,155
Who the hell orders one coffee every day but never freaking drinks it?

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,590
Dome. Jib.

34
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,410
Come see me upstairs for a bit.

35
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:07,775
I have something I need to talk to you about.

36
00:03:11,995 --> 00:03:15,490
From tomorrow on, you two don't have to come to work anymore.

37
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,520
Why not?

38
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,815
Some trouble came up in the country.

39
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,283
I think I might need to stay there for a while.

40
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:26,189
One more thing,

41
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,855
this place isn't exactly minting money.

42
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,875
Damn it.

43
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,835
Won't you try the coffee?

44
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,580
I really put my effort into making it.

45
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,560
This could be the last cup I brewed, too.

46
00:03:58,355 --> 00:03:59,860
I want to at least thank you.

47
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,160
What will you do after this?

48
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,770
Why not come work for me?

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,210
I have a museum not far from here.

50
00:04:27,555 --> 00:04:28,625
Museum?

51
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,385
I don't think I'm the guy for the job.

52
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,547
I can't see myself doing it.

53
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,750
You have no idea what you are capable of.

54
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,739
Jib?

55
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,545
What are you doing?

56
00:04:53,755 --> 00:04:54,590
Shut up.

57
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,235
That's Uncle's money.

58
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,345
Screw him.

59
00:04:58,805 --> 00:04:59,495
No.

60
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,535
He's been nice to you.

61
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,055
Give it back.

62
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,025
Nice to me?

63
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,330
He's literally just fired us.

64
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:04,260
Just give it back.

65
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:04,955
Get away!

66
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,610
Jib.

67
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,590
Like hell I'll give it back.

68
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,820
How will I live now that you fired me, geezer?

69
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,960
Jib!

70
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,350
-You jerk! 	-Stop!

71
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,030
You put me into this!

72
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:19,770
I said stop.

73
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,825
You brought this on yourself!

74
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,275
Stop.

75
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,780
Get the hell away from me!

76
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,330
You jerk!

77
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,750
Hey.

78
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:30,550
Help me!

79
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,640
Jib.

80
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,915
Dome, you!

81
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,465
Don't! No!

82
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,665
Hey.

83
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:46,645
Take this.

84
00:05:48,885 --> 00:05:49,720
For real?

85
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,525
Just take it.

86
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,860
Let's go. Let's go.

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,240
Damn.

88
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,235
Sweet.

89
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,320
Go.

90
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,280
Hurry up.

91
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,860
Hey, that's mine!

92
00:06:00,175 --> 00:06:01,720
Dome, you ass.

93
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,950
Uncle...

94
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,320
Uncle?

95
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,455
Uncle.

96
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,665
Are you alright?

97
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,465
Let's go to the hospital.

98
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:23,015
I'm alright.

99
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,760
Thanks, Dome.

100
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,610
I need to talk to you.

101
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,070
You owe me the rent for months.

102
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,530
If you can't pay,

103
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,010
move out by the end of the week.

104
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,160
You seen Dome from Room 612 around?

105
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,495
Answer me when I talk to you, jerks.

106
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:54,785
Dome!

107
00:08:55,745 --> 00:08:56,990
Hey, stop!

108
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,148
Hey!

109
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,990
Dome, stop running!

110
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,320
Dome, stop!

111
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,400
Oh, crap!

112
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,350
Stop, Dome.

113
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,845
Stop!

114
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:12,051
Dome!

115
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,988
Told you, didn't I?

116
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,990
Don't let me catch you.

117
00:09:33,095 --> 00:09:34,259
Y–You.

118
00:09:36,665 --> 00:09:38,063
We meet again.

119
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,055
Hey.

120
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,992
You have nothing to do with this. Get away.

121
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,287
Easy there.

122
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:51,515
Easy, my ass.

123
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,565
I told you to take it easy.

124
00:10:00,335 --> 00:10:02,235
What the hell, dude?

125
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,860
Crap.

126
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,473
Hey.

127
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:20,191
Just gang up on him.

128
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,875
What the hell?

129
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,863
Where the hell have they gone?

130
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,480
Crap!

131
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,496
You...

132
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:53,167
Khatha.

133
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,121
My name's Khatha.

134
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,632
Do you remember me?

135
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,412
Of course.

136
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,943
You're...

137
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,881
the customer from the cafe, right?

138
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,542
Where are you going?

139
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,930
Why don't you come inside?

140
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,007
Hurry up.

141
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:39,890
Take care of him.

142
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:41,207
I'll get changed.

143
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:42,809
Yes.

144
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,843
Mr. Dome, is it?

145
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,375
You can drop the mister.

146
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,230
Yes, Mr. Dome.

147
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,631
Welcome to Midnight Museum.

148
00:12:02,975 --> 00:12:04,021
I'm Triphob.

149
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:05,943
Please follow me.

150
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,948
Are you alright?

151
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,714
Yes.

152
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:43,535
This museum is open after sundown until two in the morning.

153
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,095
It's not open to just anyone, however.

154
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,470
Only the chosen ones can enter.

155
00:12:54,646 --> 00:12:56,881
This place houses everything from your average objects

156
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,120
to cursed artifacts

157
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,190
from all over the world.

158
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:01,980
There are no definite categories.

159
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,835
But each piece comes with an interesting story.

160
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:10,740
All of the collection here is Mr. Khatha's life work.

161
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:14,520
Who exactly is he?

162
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,710
Mr. Khatha?

163
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,420
He owns this museum.

164
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,335
Every single piece of artifacts

165
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,695
was collected by Mr. Khatha

166
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:30,945
all through his life,

167
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,670
wanting to display them all here in this place.

168
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,895
All through his life?

169
00:13:41,415 --> 00:13:42,580
Yes.

170
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:43,910
His whole life.

171
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,355
Collecting all of this?

172
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,360
How old is this Mr. Khatha?

173
00:13:53,755 --> 00:13:55,339
Please follow me.

174
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:35,795
Your main duty here will be to take care of the artifacts.

175
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,890
The only restriction for staying here is:

176
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,890
Do not enter Zone 16.

177
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,120
What do you mean...

178
00:14:44,455 --> 00:14:47,970
you can start right away.

179
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,670
I didn't say I'd take the job.

180
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:56,966
But will you?

181
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,235
What?

182
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,354
Sorry.

183
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:37,338
Did I scare you?

184
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:40,260
I'm not a ghost, you know.

185
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,400
Are you new here?

186
00:15:51,111 --> 00:15:52,010
Well?

187
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:52,893
Does the uniform fit?

188
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,268
Perfectly.

189
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:56,755
You are—

190
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,985
I'm a staff here, too.

191
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,170
You okay there?

192
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:12,600
Oh, yeah.

193
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,100
Have you worked here for a long time?

194
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,252
Yeah.

195
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,041
I guess.

196
00:16:28,965 --> 00:16:30,510
Long enough to see

197
00:16:31,715 --> 00:16:33,192
or hear something strange.

198
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,145
Strange how?

199
00:16:42,693 --> 00:16:44,216
You're not afraid of ghosts, are you?

200
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,802
Is this place haunted?

201
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,185
Yeah.

202
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,966
By way more than just ghosts.

203
00:16:55,865 --> 00:16:57,805
They have their own story.

204
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,369
But my favorite has gotta be...

205
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,805
the Bride in the Red Wedding Dress.

206
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,644
Did Triphob not tell you this place is off-limits?

207
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:13,341
He did.

208
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,575
But...

209
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,654
I...

210
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:19,340
I heard something so I came.

211
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,671
Hey.

212
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,115
Hey.

213
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:51,960
Hey.

214
00:18:53,845 --> 00:18:54,367
Hey.

215
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:57,874
Hey.

216
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,330
Hey, wake up.

217
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,416
Hey.

218
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,195
Mr. Khatha?

219
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,370
What happened?

220
00:19:25,395 --> 00:19:26,769
Fix the electricity.

221
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:27,879
Yes.

222
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:11,385
Hey.

223
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:13,713
Hey.

224
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,527
Hey.

225
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,141
Mr. Khatha.

226
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:30,704
Mr. Khatha.

227
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:31,880
Mr. Khatha.

228
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,755
Mr. Dome.

229
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,137
Mr. Dome, wake up.

230
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:50,887
Mr. Dome, you need to wake up.

231
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,740
Mr. Dome, wake up.

232
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:23,155
Mr. Dome. You need to wake up.

233
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,046
Mr. Dome.

234
00:22:33,992 --> 00:22:34,554
What?

235
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:36,093
What happened?

236
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,785
It's the Bride in the Red Wedding Dress.

237
00:22:37,785 --> 00:22:38,820
She left Zone 16.

238
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,261
What have you done?

239
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,610
Did you—

240
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:23,730
Hang on a minute.

241
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,610
Did you hear something?

242
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,380
Hear what?

243
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,114
Listen carefully.

244
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,903
The typewriter.

245
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,278
That little menace...

246
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:47,636
(The whole of Zone 16 of Midnight Museum was now dyed in red light...)

247
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,900
So that's how this stupid machine works.

248
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:57,485
What did you just say?

249
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,420
I know now that this machine is the one controlling all of this.

250
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,705
What will you do?

251
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,262
Write the ending.

252
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,403
Khatha!

253
00:25:25,915 --> 00:25:26,796
You...

254
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:27,800
Who are you?

255
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,914
Don't disturb me.

256
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,815
I'm thinking of a good ending.

257
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,429
I had it on the tip of my fingers.

258
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,125
The ending?

259
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,050
For what?

260
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,735
Give me a minute!

261
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,050
Damn it. Damn it!

262
00:25:42,655 --> 00:25:43,912
Damn it!

263
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,900
Hey... slow down.

264
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,175
Tell me.

265
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,930
I'll help you think.

266
00:25:50,955 --> 00:25:52,892
How can you even help?

267
00:25:53,475 --> 00:25:55,525
Two is better than one, right?

268
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,822
It's a story about this beautiful woman.

269
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,670
She'd dreamed of putting on a beautiful wedding dress her whole life.

270
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,830
She was on the verge of getting married.

271
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,510
But unfortunately...

272
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,595
the groom died.

273
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,447
She was stuck in her own emotions.

274
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,445
She was confused...

275
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,250
She couldn't come up with an answer

276
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:29,450
as to what she wanted in life.

277
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,131
She was a poor soul.

278
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,475
All her life,

279
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:45,470
she just wanted to marry the man she loved.

280
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:51,290
But because of a mistake she'd made,

281
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:54,581
he died.

282
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:59,550
The incident drowned the bride in her own guilt,

283
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,390
misery,

284
00:27:03,245 --> 00:27:03,850
and despair.

285
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,590
All of these feelings

286
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:11,560
turned the bride into a spirit,

287
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,569
even though she wasn't even dead.

288
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,715
But I don't know if you realize that the bride

289
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,926
is really hurting right now.

290
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:32,275
Is this my doing?

291
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:39,236
Your face basked in sorrow...

292
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:41,666
It's beautiful.

293
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,940
I finally created something perfect.

294
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:59,231
I just got an idea for a great ending.

295
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:00,890
Stop!

296
00:29:00,915 --> 00:29:02,120
Don't touch my stuff.

297
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,415
Dome!

298
00:29:43,935 --> 00:29:45,528
No!

299
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,502
Tell me.

300
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,470
How did you end it?

301
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,490
So you didn't know?

302
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,103
Not at all.

303
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,775
I only felt a connection with the dress.

304
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,255
Take a rest.

305
00:31:58,785 --> 00:32:00,003
You...

306
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,840
What's your name again?

307
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:10,929
Why can't I remember your name?

308
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:20,440
I can't seem to recall it, either.

309
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,435
This means that the power of that typewriter has changed something.

310
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,384
What do you want to be called?

311
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,568
You're free now.

312
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,642
What do you want me to call you?

313
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,767
It's your decision.

314
00:33:18,475 --> 00:33:19,576
June...

315
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:22,655
My name is June.

316
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,287
How did you end it?

317
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:47,403
I just went with something I thought would be a happy ending.

318
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,200
What exactly was that?

319
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,523
Well, it's like...

320
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,523
Finally,

321
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,945
she found what she had been looking for...

322
00:34:00,925 --> 00:34:02,497
Liberation from her past.

323
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,427
What did you do?

324
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:28,320
Something as serious as this never happened here before.

325
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:31,420
You got here for a minute and all hell broke loose.

326
00:34:34,065 --> 00:34:35,557
Who exactly are you?

327
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,252
I...

328
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,555
I just...

329
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,921
I'll go take a look.

330
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,545
Hey.

331
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,225
You take care of this room.

332
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,256
You two. Follow me.

333
00:35:48,887 --> 00:35:49,692
Don't!

334
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:20,369
Hey.

335
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,553
Hey.

336
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,180
Hey.

337
00:36:23,505 --> 00:36:24,521
Move.

338
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:27,776
Stop!

339
00:36:48,655 --> 00:36:49,730
Thanks for this.

340
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,194
If it weren't for you,

341
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:54,623
I wouldn't have thought about robbing this place.

342
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,232
Dome!

343
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:19,906
You need to take responsibility for this.

THE BRIDE IN THE RED WEDDING DRESS

348
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:05,425
All the missing artifacts are from Zone 16.

349
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:06,770
I checked.

350
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,145
No artifacts from other zones are stolen.

351
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:14,105
I'm the reason the museum was robbed.

352
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,020
You silly.

353
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:16,859
Your only fault was that

354
00:38:16,884 --> 00:38:19,144
you didn't take good care of something I gave you.

355
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,155
When I first met you,

356
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,735
I could tell right away that you're not normal.

357
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,710
Anyone seen this dagger?

358
00:38:30,915 --> 00:38:33,079
I've been looking for it the whole night.

359
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,370
Found it.

360
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,540
Petch?

361
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:44,310
You're late, man.

362
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,466
I'm going to take everything back.

363
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,100
When Khatha and Triphob come back,

364
00:38:51,242 --> 00:38:52,992
tell them this is me taking responsibility.

365
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,095
Isn't that Mr. Dome?
