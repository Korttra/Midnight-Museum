1
00:00:00,195 --> 00:00:01,838
The item you're going to the auction for...

2
00:00:01,838 --> 00:00:03,579
It will really help Dome, won't it?

3
00:00:03,579 --> 00:00:05,936
I will definitely get what I want.

4
00:00:05,936 --> 00:00:07,936
I got what I wanted.

5
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,327
So I'm giving you this.

6
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:10,685
You have to wear it at all times.

7
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:11,979
Do not ever take it off.

8
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:13,903
Dome, you're fired.

9
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:21,619
(God never abandons us.)

10
00:00:22,164 --> 00:00:24,664
(It's just the way that He helps us)

11
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:26,828
(...is different from what we've expected.)

12
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:32,034
(He created a holy land called Eden.)

13
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,779
(The land is abundant and fascinating.)

14
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:40,779
(He created a man from the dust of the ground.)

15
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:46,819
(Living alone in the world gradually became painful for him.)

16
00:00:47,675 --> 00:00:49,219
(Because of the loneliness.)

17
00:00:50,564 --> 00:00:52,973
(So God cast a deep sleep upon him.)

18
00:00:52,973 --> 00:00:57,005
(The Lord took one of his ribs and created a woman.)

19
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:00,607
(God gave her to be his life partner.)

20
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:04,780
(They were living happily in the heavenly garden.)

21
00:01:05,654 --> 00:01:08,419
(God had only one rule for them.)

22
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,137
(They were not allowed to eat the fruit)

23
00:01:10,162 --> 00:01:12,003
(from the tree of knowledge of good and evil.)

24
00:01:14,075 --> 00:01:18,637
(One day, the man and the woman met Satan.)

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,819
(Satan was created by God.)

26
00:01:23,985 --> 00:01:26,377
(Satan tricked them to eat the forbidden fruit.)

27
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:29,874
(God was furious.)

28
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,402
(He told them that they committed a deadly sin.)

29
00:01:33,402 --> 00:01:37,179
(He punished them by separating them.)

30
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:52,817
(Until today, the man is still working hard and living a lonely life.)

31
00:01:54,962 --> 00:01:57,619
(Until the day that he returns to ashes.)

32
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:16,420
Hey, Cripple.

33
00:02:16,586 --> 00:02:19,219
Don't forget to throw away broken mannequins and quality defects.

34
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,019
Can't you work faster?

35
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,019
Arm.

36
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:28,820
Let's have a drink after you're done checking these products.

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,820
You can leave the rest to Cripple to check.

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,379
I'll see you.

39
00:02:40,062 --> 00:02:45,619
(They said God won't help those who don't help themselves.)

40
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,379
(It's not strange, isn't it?)

41
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,579
(If the man starts to do something to save himself from loneliness,)

42
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:01,168
(To play the role of the Lord)

43
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:03,643
(...and create the woman that he loves by himself.)

44
00:03:11,054 --> 00:03:20,419
(So he will have a companion while waiting for the Lord's return.)

45
00:03:38,493 --> 00:03:44,302
(When that day arrives, I will ask this question to the Lord.)

46
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:51,016
(All this time, why did you abandon us?)

54
00:05:01,282 --> 00:05:03,490
Hello, do you want to have a new life?

55
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,410
A better and more valuable life.

56
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,622
Hello, do you want to have a new life?

57
00:05:09,647 --> 00:05:12,345
(Believe in the Lord. He will return. The judgment day is coming.)

58
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,420
Are you feeling that you are left alone?

59
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,690
(We are hiring.)

60
00:05:31,668 --> 00:05:32,469
Hello.

61
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:33,245
Yes.

62
00:05:33,364 --> 00:05:35,437
What kind of flower are you looking for?

63
00:05:35,437 --> 00:05:37,802
I'm looking for a job.

64
00:05:38,066 --> 00:05:39,410
You want to apply for a job.

65
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:40,725
I'll go tell the shop's owner.

66
00:05:40,725 --> 00:05:41,482
Wait a sec.

67
00:05:41,482 --> 00:05:42,605
Thank you.

68
00:05:55,531 --> 00:05:59,983
I want a bouquet to welcome a significant one back.

69
00:05:59,983 --> 00:06:01,179
Can you arrange it for me?

70
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,219
I am applying for a job here but I'm not their staff yet.

71
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:10,779
Then think of it as a test

72
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,723
If I like the bouquet that you make,

73
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:15,603
I'll tell the owner to give you the job.

74
00:06:19,435 --> 00:06:20,920
Do you like it?

75
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,705
I don't know much about flowers.

76
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:26,127
So I don't know what kind of flower I should choose

77
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,843
for a bouquet to welcome back a significant one.

78
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,001
Lily of the valley.

79
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:38,420
It means the return of happiness or rebirth.

80
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:43,219
You said you don't know about the meanings of flowers.

81
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,779
I guess you must have some kind of intuition.

82
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,875
I don't think so.

83
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,419
It's just a coincidence.

84
00:06:58,122 --> 00:07:00,020
Is it really a coincidence?

85
00:07:01,217 --> 00:07:03,579
Or do you have an intuition?

86
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:07,703
What do you mean?

87
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,619
Who are you?

88
00:07:09,817 --> 00:07:12,019
It doesn't matter who I am.

89
00:07:12,802 --> 00:07:14,420
What does matter is who you are,

90
00:07:15,137 --> 00:07:16,611
what you want,

91
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,979
and what you can do.

92
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,020
Let me help you.

93
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,979
So it's because of that.

94
00:07:52,691 --> 00:07:54,019
What are you doing?

95
00:07:55,814 --> 00:07:58,343
What you are seeing is real.

96
00:07:59,056 --> 00:08:01,025
I just want to make sure that

97
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:03,026
what's happening has nothing to do with you.

98
00:08:04,826 --> 00:08:07,802
Only God can manifest this kind of power.

99
00:08:08,254 --> 00:08:10,109
If you are not Him,

100
00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:13,017
then who are you and what do you want?

101
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:15,017
Why do you have the power that my God has?

102
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:17,228
I don't know what you are talking about.

103
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,554
Can't you stop what is happening outside?

104
00:08:19,554 --> 00:08:21,008
I won't stop.

105
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:24,648
I won't stop until you stop disrespecting my God.

106
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:27,007
Stop it.

107
00:08:28,754 --> 00:08:29,977
I said stop it!

108
00:08:41,168 --> 00:08:43,216
The Lord.

109
00:08:46,678 --> 00:08:48,641
Do you want to see me?

110
00:08:48,641 --> 00:08:50,004
Hey.

111
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:53,509
Whose flower is that?

112
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,619
I wholeheartedly believe in God.

113
00:09:41,487 --> 00:09:46,819
But I don't think he will return in the form that we expect to see.

114
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:55,177
Now I understand why you told me to give that anklet to Khatha.

115
00:09:58,634 --> 00:10:00,392
Because you wanted Khatha to use the anklet

116
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:03,028
to absorb and get rid of Dome's power.

117
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:09,008
You want Dome to stay away from the status of God as much as possible.

118
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:16,779
Now I know that the anklet is never able to get rid of Dome's power.

119
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:21,004
What I experienced today,

120
00:10:22,296 --> 00:10:23,979
It was pure power.

121
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,779
It was a great power.

122
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,419
It was the power of God.

123
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:39,617
How can you be sure what you experienced is the power of God?

124
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,866
I created many tests for Dome.

125
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:46,820
But he's not the one.

126
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:49,220
The Lord is not like that.

127
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,619
Anthika.

128
00:10:52,456 --> 00:10:57,579
If you met the Lord like I did, you would have no doubts.

129
00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:00,708
You would believe in him indisputably.

130
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:06,019
If that's what you believe,

131
00:11:07,794 --> 00:11:10,259
I will prove to you...

132
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:13,217
...that what I saw and believe...

133
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:16,780
...is real.

134
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:48,602
Do you really want to cut ties with Dome?

135
00:11:52,921 --> 00:11:56,127
I told you that my world is dangerous.

136
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,752
I don't want to put him in danger for no good reason.

137
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,208
Your and Dome's worlds are the same world.

138
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,180
Living out there doesn't mean it's safer for him than staying with you.

139
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,820
The power that he has,

140
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:13,808
It will never completely disappear.

141
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:17,611
It's something that is within him.

142
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,180
He was born with it.

143
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,442
Unlike you and I,

144
00:12:21,442 --> 00:12:23,442
We have the power from the curses.

145
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:28,305
Go take him back here.

146
00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:30,574
More importantly,

147
00:12:30,574 --> 00:12:33,131
You need to accept the feelings that you have.

148
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:34,817
You are missing Dome, aren't you?

149
00:12:36,934 --> 00:12:38,380
Nonsense.

150
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm sick of the tight-lipped people.

151
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,708
I never said I miss him.

152
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,245
I'll borrow this book.

153
00:12:44,245 --> 00:12:45,580
I return it when I'm done reading it.

154
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,182
Mr. Khatha.

155
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:58,819
Do you remember the phone belonged to one of the thieves named Jib?

156
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:03,617
Do you mean the phone that was left among the stolen artifacts?

157
00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:04,600
Yes, I remember.

158
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,016
Why?

159
00:13:08,094 --> 00:13:09,524
I tracked the number of the last

160
00:13:09,549 --> 00:13:11,663
outgoing call of the phone found at the crime scene.

161
00:13:11,663 --> 00:13:14,380
It's the number of the owner of this antique shop.

162
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,576
Did you involve in the robbery?

163
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:19,180
Tell me everything and I will treat you as a witness.

164
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:21,580
That's nonsense.

165
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,629
Jib just told me he had cool items to sell to me.

166
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:27,552
You can be charged for a fencing crime.

167
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:29,755
How would I know that they were stolen?

168
00:13:29,755 --> 00:13:32,419
Most of the items sold in my shop are shady items.

169
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,194
I didn't buy anything from him.

170
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:35,979
He wanted to double the price.

171
00:13:35,979 --> 00:13:38,377
I wasn't stupid enough to pay him that much.

172
00:13:38,663 --> 00:13:43,179
Do you know if Jib knew other antique dealers?

173
00:13:55,524 --> 00:13:57,373
He gave me this card.

174
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:59,897
He said if I had interesting items, I should contact this place.

175
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:03,619
They bought all kinds of antique items and offered great prices.

176
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:08,419
This is...

177
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:18,020
I got what I wanted.

178
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,171
If there's anything else I need in the future,

179
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,407
I'll be sure to take it over from you.

180
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:27,619
Do you know it?

181
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,305
I saw this symbol at the auction I attended recently.

182
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:38,379
Triphob, do you remember the woman who was the High Priestess?

183
00:14:38,838 --> 00:14:40,200
Yes.

184
00:14:43,974 --> 00:14:47,407
I think this woman might be behind everything.

185
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:49,665
I got it.

186
00:14:49,665 --> 00:14:51,619
I will dig up everything about her.

187
00:14:54,662 --> 00:14:56,422
I'll tell you later.

188
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,462
I'm sorry

189
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,420
Thanks.

190
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,755
(On the day that I found a way to escape from the room,)

191
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,678
(It's like you send someone to check on me.)

192
00:15:31,703 --> 00:15:33,273
(To make sure that no matter where I go,)

193
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:36,036
(I will still be in the prison that you created.)

194
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:52,311
(Maybe You just tried to scare me.)

195
00:15:52,311 --> 00:15:54,604
(So I would feel that I needed to run away all the time.)

196
00:16:01,478 --> 00:16:04,306
(There's no way I can find my place.)

197
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:08,382
(There's no way I can settle down and create my family.)

198
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:16,819
(I hope that You are watching me.)

199
00:16:17,515 --> 00:16:22,248
(I hope You feel like a winner in the game that You created.)

200
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:27,579
(Because I don't want to keep fighting in a game that I can never win.)

201
00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:28,819
I'm sorry, Anne.

202
00:16:29,785 --> 00:16:31,773
I'm sorry that you have to see this.

203
00:16:42,641 --> 00:16:44,420
(Dear, God.)

204
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:47,979
(I can no longer wait for Your blessing.)

205
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:50,379
(If You don't come down to save me,)

206
00:16:51,897 --> 00:16:54,019
(I will have to go up to see You.)

207
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:02,379
(When we finally meet, please be kind to me.)

208
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:07,680
Anne.

209
00:18:24,466 --> 00:18:25,709
Hello.

210
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,817
I'm Ton.

211
00:18:31,964 --> 00:18:33,619
You...

212
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:37,180
Your name is...

213
00:18:37,548 --> 00:18:39,579
...Anne.

214
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,219
Anne.

215
00:18:46,331 --> 00:18:48,019
Anne.

216
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:53,977
Ton.

217
00:18:56,705 --> 00:18:57,617
Anne.

218
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:03,579
Ton.

219
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:06,605
Anne.

220
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,020
Anne.

221
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,820
Ton.

222
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:21,620
(You finally answered my prayer.)

223
00:19:21,915 --> 00:19:22,779
Anne.

224
00:19:28,893 --> 00:19:31,220
(But I guess my prayer wasn't loud enough.)

225
00:19:38,097 --> 00:19:41,979
(Still, I want to thank you for sending Anne into my life.)

226
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,041
(I promise that I will do my best to protect her.)

227
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:56,380
(Although she is not perfect,)

228
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:02,379
(I will fulfill her empty life.)

229
00:20:22,601 --> 00:20:23,871
Do...

230
00:20:23,871 --> 00:20:25,217
not...

231
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:26,380
do...

232
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:27,619
that...

233
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:28,780
...again

234
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:52,777
You also have a heart.

235
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:58,205
A heart?

236
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:01,220
Yes, a heart.

237
00:21:05,496 --> 00:21:07,177
Where?

238
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,379
Since we are humans.

239
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:28,207
Every human has a heart.

240
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,290
(Mr. Khatha)

241
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,579
Could you keep the noise down?

242
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:38,377
Hello.

243
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,419
(Mr. Khatha, do you hear me?)

244
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:49,814
If you are listening,

245
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:53,505
You don't have to worry about me.

246
00:22:54,337 --> 00:22:55,908
I'm doing fine.

247
00:22:58,028 --> 00:22:59,979
(I feel lonely sometimes.)

248
00:23:00,684 --> 00:23:06,017
(Because I don't get to see June, Mr. Triphob, and you.)

249
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,813
(What you are seeing is real)

250
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,036
I just want to make sure that

251
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,432
what's happening has nothing to do with you.

252
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:27,619
Everything is fine.

253
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:30,017
I get a good sleep.

254
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,416
I don't have nightmares anymore.

255
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:42,019
(I hope everyone at the museum including you is happy.)

256
00:23:46,848 --> 00:23:48,605
(Please take care of your health.)

257
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,573
(Don't die again if you can avoid it.)

258
00:25:28,229 --> 00:25:29,100
How did you come here?

259
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,336
Don't ask anything.

260
00:25:30,336 --> 00:25:31,832
You need to come with me today.

261
00:25:31,832 --> 00:25:32,517
Where are we going?

262
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:35,437
Hurry and go get changed.

263
00:25:36,241 --> 00:25:38,419
June, where are we going?

264
00:25:38,881 --> 00:25:40,260
Come on.

265
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,182
What's wrong?

266
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:45,619
(I won't let You destroy this precious gift.)

267
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,979
(I won't let You hurt Anne the way You hurt me.)

268
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:57,001
(Never.)

269
00:27:00,971 --> 00:27:02,419
I will fix it.

270
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,979
Your leg will be normal.

271
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:10,259
I promise.

272
00:27:24,158 --> 00:27:25,180
Dome.

273
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:27,580
Dome, hurry up.

274
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,817
Dome.

275
00:27:28,817 --> 00:27:29,977
Come on.

276
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:34,066
What are you waiting for?

277
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:36,019
Let's go. Let's play that one.

278
00:28:03,142 --> 00:28:05,979
Dome, why don't you spread your arms out like this?

279
00:28:08,736 --> 00:28:10,779
After finishing this, let's go home.

280
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:13,177
Aren't you having fun?

281
00:28:13,674 --> 00:28:17,451
I thought anyone would be happy when coming to an amusement park.

282
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:19,805
Since the place is called an amusement park.

283
00:28:20,903 --> 00:28:22,777
But I'm not anyone.

284
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,179
But I'm having fun.

285
00:28:26,878 --> 00:28:33,004
Now I understand why humans are happy when they play rides.

286
00:28:37,305 --> 00:28:40,817
Because it makes you feel alive.

287
00:28:41,152 --> 00:28:44,380
The moment when the ride I played was moving up high,

288
00:28:44,742 --> 00:28:46,779
I thought to myself.

289
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:50,419
"Wow, this's how life is."

290
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:55,217
You are talking as if you aren't a human.

291
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:58,779
What about you?

292
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,419
What have you been doing after you left the museum?

293
00:29:03,272 --> 00:29:05,408
Do you have any goals in life?

294
00:29:09,564 --> 00:29:13,905
I'm finding a job and living my life.

295
00:29:14,466 --> 00:29:15,991
What about you, June?

296
00:29:15,991 --> 00:29:17,979
Do you have any goals in life?

297
00:29:21,805 --> 00:29:23,410
I just found it.

298
00:29:24,065 --> 00:29:28,819
I plan to play rides another 5,000 times.

299
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:31,219
So I will know what life is.

300
00:29:33,028 --> 00:29:39,582
I want to understand more about humans' fear, happiness, and suffering.

301
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:42,662
You don't need to take rides 5,000 times to learn that.

302
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:44,377
But I like it.

303
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,779
Take your hands off it.

304
00:30:01,081 --> 00:30:02,419
I'll go to the toilet.

305
00:30:03,142 --> 00:30:04,373
Wait.

306
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:07,220
Are you feeling nauseous because of the merry-go-round?

307
00:30:56,976 --> 00:30:58,060
Dome.

308
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:28,062
Dome, what's wrong?

309
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:29,275
What's going on?

310
00:31:29,275 --> 00:31:30,700
Let's go home.

311
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,410
(Dome is calling.)

312
00:31:57,745 --> 00:31:59,977
Aren't you going to answer it?

313
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,730
(Dome is calling.)

314
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,619
Yes.

315
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:19,983
Okay.

316
00:32:19,983 --> 00:32:22,217
I'll see you at your apartment in half an hour.

317
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:25,217
Yes.

318
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:30,019
Is that Shorty?

319
00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:31,847
Are you going out to have dinner somewhere?

320
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:33,579
It was Dome.

321
00:32:34,245 --> 00:32:36,696
He called to tell that the crystal is cracking.

322
00:32:36,696 --> 00:32:39,106
He also encountered something strange.

323
00:32:39,602 --> 00:32:41,368
He is with Miss June.

324
00:32:41,368 --> 00:32:43,180
They are heading back to Dome's apartment.

325
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,949
Are you going with me?

326
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:46,481
I'll drive. You drive too slowly.

327
00:32:46,481 --> 00:32:47,980
Hurry and follow me.

328
00:32:58,871 --> 00:33:01,219
Do you want company?

329
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,607
Do you want it?

330
00:33:14,148 --> 00:33:15,134
How much?

331
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:16,095
1,000 baht.

332
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,574
300 baht for a room.

333
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,179
I have a room.

334
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:21,577
Can I see your face?

335
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:26,047
Alright.

336
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:27,598
1,500 baht for off-site work.

337
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:28,779
Are you okay with it?

338
00:33:30,626 --> 00:33:32,420
Where is your room?

339
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,902
What are you waiting for?

340
00:33:43,902 --> 00:33:45,416
Let's go.

341
00:34:57,854 --> 00:34:58,782
Let me go.

342
00:34:58,912 --> 00:35:00,557
Let me go.

343
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:01,897
Shh!

344
00:35:05,462 --> 00:35:07,217
Let me go.

345
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,379
Let me go.

346
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,453
It's your turn.

347
00:36:23,914 --> 00:36:27,619
(I'll do everything to make Anne feel like a normal person.)

348
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:32,072
(No one can hurt her, not even God.)

349
00:36:45,797 --> 00:36:50,245
(Even if I have to point a knife at the Lord.)

350
00:36:50,245 --> 00:36:52,780
Don't worry, Dome. I'll stay with you tonight.

351
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:58,819
I shouldn't have called Mr. Triphob.

352
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:01,220
I don't want to bother anyone anymore.

353
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,779
Do you think that we aren't worried about you?

354
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,807
Listen.

355
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:11,552
What happened at the amusement park is a big deal.

356
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,794
It means that

357
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:16,375
the crystal anklet that Khatha said can protect you from anything is...

358
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,617
not working anymore.

359
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:21,579
It means you are in danger.

360
00:37:25,434 --> 00:37:27,571
Stop frowning.

361
00:37:27,571 --> 00:37:29,571
Come on. Let's go in your room.

362
00:37:42,271 --> 00:37:43,789
I...

363
00:37:44,277 --> 00:37:45,579
want...

364
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:47,980
...a leg.

365
00:37:56,871 --> 00:37:58,485
That...

366
00:37:58,485 --> 00:37:59,705
...slim...

367
00:37:59,705 --> 00:38:01,217
...leg.

368
00:38:10,819 --> 00:38:12,930
I guess Khatha and Triphob are here.

369
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,377
I'll open the door.

370
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,377
Who is it?

371
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:28,562
You are...

372
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:38,004
Mr. Dome.

373
00:38:38,004 --> 00:38:39,620
It's me, Triphob.

374
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:43,965
Mr. Dome.

375
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:45,579
Mr. Dome.

376
00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:47,977
Mr. Dome.

377
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:58,219
June.

378
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,979
June.

379
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:03,008
June.

380
00:39:03,398 --> 00:39:04,143
June.

381
00:39:04,478 --> 00:39:06,637
June, hang in there.

382
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,420
Tell me what happened.

383
00:39:10,825 --> 00:39:11,980
Dome.

384
00:39:13,106 --> 00:39:14,377
Huh?

385
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,503
Dome is abducted.

386
00:39:18,428 --> 00:39:19,909
Where, June?

387
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:24,625
Where?

388
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,059
Please take care of June.

389
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:30,019
Sure.

390
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:07,859
(I will do anything to help Anne.)

391
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,508
(Even though I have to hurt...)

392
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:15,106
(...Your man.)

393
00:40:26,416 --> 00:40:28,240
Anne, are you sure?

394
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:35,509
I'm worried that the leg won't fit you again.

395
00:40:35,908 --> 00:40:40,309
Maybe an artificial leg is more suitable for you.

396
00:40:40,675 --> 00:40:43,179
I'll make a new leg for you.

397
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,579
What do you think?

398
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:54,019
Why are you changing your mind?

399
00:40:55,848 --> 00:40:58,817
We are about to be happy.

400
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,722
But we are happy now.

401
00:41:06,722 --> 00:41:10,820
We are together and live normal life.

402
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,616
We have each other.

403
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,845
We have a family.

404
00:41:14,845 --> 00:41:16,779
I...

405
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:19,785
...want to be complete.

406
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,808
That.

407
00:41:28,477 --> 00:41:31,182
It will complete us.

408
00:41:46,365 --> 00:41:47,976
Why are doing this to me?

409
00:41:49,789 --> 00:41:51,272
Let me go.

410
00:41:53,749 --> 00:41:56,417
Do you know who he is, Ton?

411
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,817
That day.

412
00:41:59,561 --> 00:42:01,219
At the museum.

413
00:42:01,536 --> 00:42:03,622
Because of his power.

414
00:42:04,377 --> 00:42:06,017
You were brought to life.

415
00:42:22,004 --> 00:42:23,979
Don't you want to be free?

416
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:28,776
Free from God who has been bullying you.

417
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,902
This is your test.

418
00:42:31,902 --> 00:42:35,720
His power can set you free.

419
00:42:36,327 --> 00:42:38,380
It will set us free.

420
00:42:38,872 --> 00:42:40,779
But his power,

421
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:46,819
It is being suppressed by the anklet.

422
00:42:47,242 --> 00:42:49,219
Cut his leg off.

423
00:42:49,712 --> 00:42:51,620
Release the power.

424
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:54,017
We will be free.

425
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:22,250
I'm sorry.

426
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:24,805
But I have to do it.

427
00:43:24,805 --> 00:43:27,970
What you are doing is not what people with the right mind would do.

428
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,832
Think about it.

429
00:43:29,832 --> 00:43:31,180
Don't listen to him.

430
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:45,620
Go away.

431
00:43:49,688 --> 00:43:51,106
Mr. Khatha.

432
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:12,426
Mr. Khatha.

433
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:14,878
Long time no see.

434
00:44:16,291 --> 00:44:17,531
Don't interrupt my plan.

435
00:44:17,531 --> 00:44:19,219
I don't want to go back.

436
00:44:25,965 --> 00:44:27,620
You are...

437
00:44:28,133 --> 00:44:30,017
You are my mannequin.

438
00:44:30,299 --> 00:44:31,364
I've been looking for you.

439
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:32,397
You are here.

440
00:44:32,397 --> 00:44:34,091
I'm not your property.

441
00:44:43,066 --> 00:44:44,382
Listen to me.

442
00:44:44,654 --> 00:44:46,779
You need to go back to the museum with me.

443
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:50,419
You don't need to stay in Zone 16.

444
00:44:51,494 --> 00:44:52,822
You will be free.

445
00:44:55,331 --> 00:44:57,579
Isn't that what you want?

446
00:44:57,579 --> 00:44:58,549
Don't listen to him.

447
00:44:58,549 --> 00:44:59,982
Listen to me only.

448
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,857
No.

449
00:45:28,909 --> 00:45:29,982
Dome.

450
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,622
Dome.

451
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,219
Dome.

452
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:42,674
You.

453
00:45:53,026 --> 00:45:54,019
Anne.

454
00:45:55,081 --> 00:45:56,417
What did you do to Anne?

455
00:45:57,637 --> 00:46:00,506
What did you do to her?!

456
00:46:00,988 --> 00:46:02,380
What did you do to her?!

457
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,177
Dome.

458
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:09,007
Dome.

459
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:15,577
You are stupid.

460
00:46:17,982 --> 00:46:21,616
You were praying to the wind and the sky hoping that God would hear you.

461
00:46:23,232 --> 00:46:25,179
Your God doesn't exist.

462
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:28,823
If He existed, He would have answered your prayer.

463
00:46:29,551 --> 00:46:32,880
Even though you now realize who God is,

464
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:36,020
He will hear your prayer.

465
00:46:39,976 --> 00:46:41,185
Shitty God.

466
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,179
(Your name is Anne.)

467
00:46:49,394 --> 00:46:50,423
Anne.

468
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:56,656
(If we are humans,)

469
00:46:56,656 --> 00:46:57,760
(Every human has a heart.)

470
00:46:59,005 --> 00:47:00,659
(I want to be complete.)

471
00:47:10,736 --> 00:47:12,072
He will never listen to a prayer

472
00:47:12,097 --> 00:47:15,601
from a petty non-human creature like you.

473
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:22,780
You are just a cursed artifact that was kept in a display case.

474
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:28,213
A cursed artifact like you doesn't deserve to be alive.

475
00:47:28,873 --> 00:47:32,345
Return to your original form.

476
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:38,420
Stay captive until the day that this world ends, stupid mannequin.

477
00:47:58,657 --> 00:48:00,019
No.

478
00:48:07,272 --> 00:48:09,401
He will return.

479
00:48:09,401 --> 00:48:13,182
He will return with the greatest power on a Blood Moon night.

480
00:48:14,656 --> 00:48:16,823
No one can stop him.

481
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,379
He will be the new God.

482
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:20,937
I will be the only one who stands by his side.

483
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:41,979
Dome.

484
00:48:43,625 --> 00:48:44,908
Dome.

485
00:48:48,454 --> 00:48:49,309
Dome.

486
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:50,419
Dome.

487
00:48:51,155 --> 00:48:52,822
Dome.

488
00:48:53,202 --> 00:48:54,605
Wake up, Dome.

489
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,108
Dome.

490
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,509
Dome.

491
00:49:08,831 --> 00:49:09,822
Dome.

Dome.

499
00:49:56,281 --> 00:49:57,847
Dome, are you back to normal?

500
00:49:57,872 --> 00:49:58,697
You are not Dome.

501
00:50:00,374 --> 00:50:01,607
Who are you?

502
00:50:01,607 --> 00:50:02,884
Let's play game.

503
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:05,985
June, you also brought back here.

504
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:07,568
I didn't go anywhere.

505
00:50:07,568 --> 00:50:09,568
Where are you?

506
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,373
I'm in the past.

507
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,420
In my past.
