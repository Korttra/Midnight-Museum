1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,210
You are…

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,970
Dome is abducted.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,170
Dome!

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:15,570
Dome!

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,800
Dome!

6
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,410
Dome!

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,620
What the hell did you do that for?

8
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,490
What?

9
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,860
Oh.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,620
Alright, then, bastard.

11
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,610
You’re asking for it, huh?

12
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,610
How is Mr. Dome doing?

13
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,410
His vitals are good.

14
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,810
But there is no sign of him waking up soon.

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,210
[Movement detected in front of the museum]

16
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,180
Hey, careful!

17
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,720
Hey.

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,380
That’s the third time this week.

19
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,170
I’m not giving him another ride home anymore.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,170
Hey.

21
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,970
For someone your size, you’re annoyingly loud.

22
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,090
Careful!

23
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,200
Mr. Khatha, sir—

24
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,180
Triphob, I know. I don’t need your lecture.

25
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,280
Don’t you even start.

26
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,970
Wanna come see Dome?

27
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,570
Her name is Anthika.

28
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,220
She’s been hiding in the antique business for ten years.

29
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,620
The reason you never heard of her before

30
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,010
was probably because she always goes by an alias.

31
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,380
At the auction, she went by The High Priestess.

32
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,820
Triphob.

33
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,110
Triphob.

34
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,110
Dome is missing.

35
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,000
I call this place “The Limbo.”

36
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,780
You can call it

37
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,540
the “seam” between space and time,

38
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,190
a parallel universe.

39
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,820
But honestly?

40
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,170
Call it whatever you want.

41
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,570
Because in reality,

42
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,980
no one has ever named it anyway.

43
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,230
So I call it what I want… The Limbo.

44
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,570
Hey.

45
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,040
Snap out of it already.

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,370
Stay with me.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,500
I met you before.

48
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,410
You’re right.

49
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,210
I tried making contact with you twice…

50
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,190
One, two…

51
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,770
I think two or three times.

52
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,420
But it took me some effort to drag you out here.

53
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,260
Hey.

54
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,460
You’re curious, aren’t you?

55
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:40,810
You’re wondering why we look the same.

56
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,700
Well, the easy answer is

57
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,380
everyone shares the same face.

58
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,200
I guess the Creator just really likes this mold.

59
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,100
But if you ask me? This mug’s boring.

60
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,890
Oh…

61
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,570
You know what?

62
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,400
I’ll have you stand here and watch it play out.

63
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,610
I’ll be right back.

64
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,050
Where are you going?

65
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,580
Watch what play out?

66
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,380
My bad.

67
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,970
What is this?

68
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,580
Dome.

69
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,610
Dome.

70
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,020
Khatha!

71
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,800
Dome?

72
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,610
You look just as stupid as you did before.

73
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,410
Your silliness ages like fine wine.

74
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:07,670
I’ve missed the hell out of you.

75
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,580
Dome?

76
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,820
Mr. Khatha.

77
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,840
Dome?

78
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,550
You’re better now?

79
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,810
He’s not Dome.

80
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,380
Who are you?

81
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,170
Okay, then.

82
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,980
I know that everything that’s happened to you guys seems

83
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,900
unreal and extremely unbelievable.

84
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,020
But so many unreal and unbelievable situations

85
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,580
have happened repeatedly countless times before.

86
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,370
But of course there is a first time for everything.

87
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,010
My name is One.

88
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,410
It’s short for…

89
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,810
The One.

90
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,100
And it’s me who caused all this trouble.

91
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,530
Tor Thanaphob

92
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,690

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,010
Directed by Attaporn Theemakorn

98
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,970
Where is Dome?

99
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,900
He's here.

100
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,970
Not right here, though.

101
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,980
What do you want?

102
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,370
Oh, that.

103
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,180
To heal a poor man’s sightless eyes.

104
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,970
To give a muted companion a voice.

105
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:35,970
To ease the pain weakening a warrior’s leg.

106
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:40,780
Why are you speaking in riddles?

107
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,730
Why don’t we play a game?

108
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,530
What for?

109
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,800
What’s with all the questions?

110
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,570
Do you even want to see Dome?

111
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,220
This game is not unlike the rest.

112
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,170
Just stay alive before it’s game over.

113
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,570
Most importantly…

114
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,570
Find out who killed the witch.

115
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,310
What’s going on?

116
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,430
Hey.

117
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,660
It’s Dome.

118
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,370
It’s not him.

119
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,670
Listen up, guys!

120
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,570
Let’s start our game.

121
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,570
You said we need to find out who killed the witch.

122
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,970
What witch?

123
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,570
Oh, but it’d take all the fun out of it if I told you.

124
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,332
Let us meet the first Thai person

125
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,134
to ever come into contact with a witch.

126
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:46,210
May 18th, 1820.

127
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,881
On the sixth day of the waxing moon of

128
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:50,895
the seventh month, Year of the Dragon,

129
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,970
in a small village right at the heart of Old Bangkok,

130
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,970
an epidemic was plaguing the entire city, taking countless lives.

131
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,600
At the time, I was 21 years old.

132
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,570
One nightfall,

133
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:16,770
a boat came and hit the pier by the waterside.

134
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:29,970
Who is it?

135
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,570
Hey.

136
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey.

137
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,770
What are you doing sleeping in a boat?

138
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,770
Come.

139
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,970
I’ll help you up.

140
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,890
Help!

141
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,580
Is that…

142
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,400
Mr. Chan,

143
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,370
Mr. Khatha’s younger brother.

144
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,560
Ding-ding!

145
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,370
Is that…

146
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:32,380
Mr. Chan,

147
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,610
Mr. Khatha’s younger brother.

148
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,370
Ding-ding!

149
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,580
Stop this.

150
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,970
I can’t.

151
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,370
The game is already on.

152
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,170
Where are you going?

153
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,770
You can’t run from the truth.

154
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,130
After that incident,

155
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,570
Khatha became so grateful for Chan.

156
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,030
Chan didn’t only save Khatha from drowning,

157
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,590
but also healed his crippling leg.

158
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,370
Let me help you.

159
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,770
From now on,

160
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,370
you have nothing to be ashamed of.

161
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,750
How…

162
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,550
How did you do it?

163
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,550
I don’t know.

164
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,520
Just please don’t—

165
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,380
I truly thank you.

166
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,780
Thank you.

167
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,780
Within a short period of time,

168
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:51,570
the two of them formed a strong brotherly bond.

169
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,380
What are you?

170
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,040
When Khatha learned that Chan was also a friendless orphan just like him,

171
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,770
he asked Chan to come live with him.

172
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:08,370
I am also without a companion nor family.

173
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,570
Would it be impertinent of me to think of you as my brother?

174
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,260
Everything was all happily ever after…

175
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,600
and then came Boon.

176
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,770
This is Mr. Boon.

177
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,340
He was a villager ravaged by the catastrophic pandemic, known as…

178
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,770
Cholera.

179
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,770
It was 1820.

180
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,110
The Cholera Outbreak had reached and swept through Bangkok,

181
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:52,200
killing thousands of people.

182
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,650
It was easily contacted.

183
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,170
The cause?

184
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,770
Contaminated water.

185
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,600
- Bam! - Bam.

186
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,590
Bam.

187
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,380
Bam.

188
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,570
Bam!

189
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,417
The symptoms included diarrhea

190
00:17:18,442 --> 00:17:20,820
- ...vomiting and body forcing everything out. - Bam! Bam!

191
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,300
It was like all the water had been drained off the body.

192
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,210
In the worst case scenario, the patient’s skin would turn bluish grey.

193
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,780
Because of uncontrollable diarrhea and vomiting,

194
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,570
the body started experiencing severe dehydration,

195
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,980
and severe loss of electrolytes.

196
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,960
- Mr. Khatha, help her! - The end result was death.

197
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,940
Mr. Khatha!

198
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,950
Bam.

199
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,980
Mr. Khatha, help!

200
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,580
I should help him.

201
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,970
Do not.

202
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,370
I can help him like I helped you.

203
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,570
Chan.

204
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,580
Do you not fear that people might accuse you of using black magic?

205
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:05,970
I’m just going to save him, not hurt him.

206
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,370
You do not understand.

207
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,331
The nobility always use such tactics

208
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,824
to imprison whom they think of as freaks.

209
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,280
Do not go looking for trouble.

210
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,900
We have enough with simply the two of us.

211
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,370
Do not get involved.

212
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,770
You have to save Bam, Mr. Khatha.

213
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,480
Mr. Khatha!

214
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,180
I told you to stop.

215
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,180
It’s you who needs to stop all this.

216
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,200
You can’t go forward

217
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,170
if you don’t turn around and take a look.

218
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,380
Chan.

219
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,100
Trust me.

220
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,170
Do not get involved with them.

221
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,770
You didn’t take me for a freak.

222
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,080
Maybe he won’t, either.

223
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,580
Chan, please.

224
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:32,370
I do not want to risk losing you.

225
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,780
Khatha, listen to me.

226
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,770
June.

227
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,170
Please take care of Bam.

228
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,380
Triphob…

229
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:45,180
Triphob.

230
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,770
Triphob, what are you doing?

231
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:15,570
Bam…

232
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,570
Bam…

233
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,800
Bam!

234
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,570
Bam!

235
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,060
Bam, wake up.

236
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,660
Bam!

237
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,370
No, no… Bam.

238
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,570
Bam!

239
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,820
Bam…

240
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,180
This isn’t true.

241
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,570
Bam can’t be dead.

242
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,940
You sure?

243
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,370
Wanna bet?

244
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,970
Bam.

245
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:04,780
Bam.

246
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,970
Bam.

247
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,210
Triphob, I…

248
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,950
I…

249
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,570
I’m…

250
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,370
I’m sorry.

251
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,570
That day…

252
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,180
Though I was able to bring Chan home,

253
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,970
he decided to go back and save Boon anyway.

254
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,770
Chan saved Boon’s life, and many other people’s.

255
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:02,380
What I had feared came true.

256
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:09,570
Ever since that day, the villagers worshipped Chan as The Magician.

257
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,370
You’re playing the Witch’s Game.

258
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,770
Yeah, so?

259
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,370
What are you doing?

260
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,780
You can’t cheat your way out of this.

261
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,380
I’m warning you.

262
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,570
Triphob!

263
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,960
Triphob!

264
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:30,900
Khatha, what’s happened?

265
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,380
No. Triphob!

266
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,770
No…

267
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:42,390
Triphob.

268
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,570
Phob.

269
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,970
Triphob.

270
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:50,650
Phob.

271
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,370
Triphob.

272
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,780
Triphob!

273
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,370
Triphob.

274
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,580
Bye-bye.

275
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:15,579
Khatha.

276
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:16,779
What’s wrong?

277
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,379
June?

278
00:25:23,496 --> 00:25:25,179
You…

279
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:28,300
Can you see me?

280
00:25:29,617 --> 00:25:31,179
What?

281
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,979
June, are you here, too?

282
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,109
Here where?

283
00:25:40,534 --> 00:25:41,980
I’m right where we have been.

284
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:45,579
Where are you?

285
00:25:47,091 --> 00:25:49,179
I’m…

286
00:25:51,903 --> 00:25:53,383
I’m in the past.

287
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,579
My past.

288
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:01,900
Dome…

289
00:26:03,225 --> 00:26:04,779
Is Dome there?

290
00:26:09,071 --> 00:26:10,779
No.

291
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:13,177
I don’t see him.

292
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:26,379
What have you done?

293
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,505
I told you you couldn’t cheat your way out.

294
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,160
Khatha.

295
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,577
Just hurry up and finish this game.

296
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:35,977
If it wasn’t for him in the first place—

297
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:53,979
You…

298
00:26:55,272 --> 00:26:56,379
What’s happening?

299
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:05,982
Hey!

300
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:13,783
The Magician, please save us.

301
00:27:14,228 --> 00:27:17,543
The Magician, please help us.

302
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:19,802
The Magician.

303
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,979
You are not to enter the ashram.

304
00:27:28,361 --> 00:27:29,980
Why not?

305
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,579
He is not someone you can simply joke around with.

306
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:35,872
He and you are from two different castes.

307
00:27:35,872 --> 00:27:39,493
Do not delude yourself that Chan saved you because you are above others.

308
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,884
You are just as much of a riffraff as I am.

309
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:44,379
Chan and I are like brothers.

310
00:27:45,035 --> 00:27:48,605
But you… you are not related to him in any way.

311
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,579
Are you certain

312
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:55,179
that he would think you more special than I?

313
00:28:12,865 --> 00:28:15,582
The Magician, please save us.

314
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:19,173
The Magician, please save us.

315
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,912
The Magician.

316
00:28:26,681 --> 00:28:27,580
In the end,

317
00:28:28,211 --> 00:28:32,379
Chan and Khatha’s paths diverged.

318
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:35,506
He could only hope that

319
00:28:35,928 --> 00:28:38,379
one day they would walk side by side once again,

320
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:41,979
just like when there were only the two of them.

321
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,979
Attention, attention!

322
00:28:49,137 --> 00:28:51,008
Listen up, folks.

323
00:28:52,282 --> 00:28:55,179
I come bearing golden opportunity for all brave men.

324
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,782
We are here today in search of courageous soldiers

325
00:28:59,454 --> 00:29:01,179
who shall make a name for himself,

326
00:29:02,881 --> 00:29:04,779
and make his beloved proud.

327
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,472
It shall be your greatest glory.

328
00:29:07,472 --> 00:29:09,545
Khatha didn’t want to be a soldier.

329
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,582
But if there was a way

330
00:29:11,582 --> 00:29:13,693
that a riffraff like him

331
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:16,779
could stand on equal ground with The Magician…

332
00:29:17,911 --> 00:29:19,179
Then I would do it.

333
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:23,979
Sir.

334
00:29:25,077 --> 00:29:26,379
I want to be a soldier.

335
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,376
Can I join your infantry?

336
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:31,180
It’s The Magician

337
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,760
It’s The Magician. Let’s go.

338
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:33,240
Let's go.

339
00:29:33,248 --> 00:29:34,234
It’s The Magician.

340
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,857
Come quickly. The Magician is here.

341
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:37,045
The Magician.

342
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:39,008
The Magician, please grace upon us.

343
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:40,543
Save us.

344
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,979
Save us.

345
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:43,179
The Magician.

346
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,574
The Magician.

347
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,220
It was uncommon

348
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,979
for people to bow their heads to anyone

349
00:29:49,474 --> 00:29:51,577
that wasn’t Ming’s Lord.

350
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:56,377
Sir. Please, sir.

351
00:29:56,452 --> 00:29:57,060
Stop, asshole!

352
00:29:57,085 --> 00:29:58,078
Please, do not take this to heart, sir.

353
00:29:58,078 --> 00:29:59,339
I said stop, you asshole!

354
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:01,808
How dare you?

355
00:30:03,838 --> 00:30:04,854
You scum of a soldier.

356
00:30:04,854 --> 00:30:05,980
Get out of here.

357
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,085
Get out!

358
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,275
Go away!

359
00:30:10,743 --> 00:30:13,177
Go away!

360
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,779
How dare you do this to The Magician?

361
00:30:24,368 --> 00:30:25,909
“The Magician”?

362
00:30:29,337 --> 00:30:30,983
I would like to see him defend that title.

363
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:35,977
Will my blade cut through you?

364
00:30:41,931 --> 00:30:43,816
So you are merely a man, just like I am.

365
00:30:43,816 --> 00:30:45,577
Get out of here.

366
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,309
You are not welcomed here.

367
00:30:47,727 --> 00:30:49,179
You have no right to be here.

368
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,779
This country belongs to my Lord.

369
00:30:54,082 --> 00:30:55,905
Who are you to give me orders?

370
00:31:10,197 --> 00:31:11,405
Chan!

371
00:31:12,976 --> 00:31:14,994
Chan, do not do it!

372
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:19,168
If you are not welcomed,

373
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:21,579
then you have no right to be here.

374
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,411
My Lord will hear about this—

375
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:42,277
It was The Magician’s doing.

376
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,379
The Magician!

377
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,068
The Magician!

378
00:31:46,728 --> 00:31:48,431
The Magician!

379
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,094
The Magician has come to save us!

380
00:31:52,783 --> 00:31:53,979
The Magician!

381
00:31:54,275 --> 00:31:55,179
Chan.

382
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:57,579
You must not do this.

383
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,780
Those soldiers will—

384
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,500
What would you have me do?

385
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,779
Let them oppress these people?

386
00:32:06,576 --> 00:32:08,379
If you are on their side,

387
00:32:11,023 --> 00:32:13,179
just leave this village.

388
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:23,509
Wait.

389
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:36,600
Are you really leaving?

390
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:39,579
Can’t you just tell him you’re sorry?

391
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,779
I have no reasons to apologize to him.

392
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,579
Then just stay.

393
00:33:52,779 --> 00:33:53,979
Stay with me.

394
00:33:57,807 --> 00:33:58,777
Chan.

395
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:04,084
You and I have not been together for a long time,

396
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:05,977
ever since you have them.

397
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:08,379
What do you want me to do?

398
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,380
Leave this place with me.

399
00:34:28,549 --> 00:34:31,179
It will be just us two brothers like it once was.

400
00:34:32,191 --> 00:34:33,577
Just you and me.

401
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:38,379
But I don’t have to hide my power here.

402
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:39,694
I don’t have to be afraid.

403
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:40,780
I can be myself.

404
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,608
A freak, you mean?

405
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,511
Chan.

406
00:34:45,511 --> 00:34:48,056
Do you realize what a freak you have become since they take you in—

407
00:34:48,056 --> 00:34:49,177
Khatha!

408
00:34:53,407 --> 00:34:54,605
Chan.

409
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:07,805
Go.

410
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:45,579
Chan.

411
00:36:07,601 --> 00:36:08,808
Chan.

412
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:08,380
Do you truly want to join the palace’s guards?

413
00:37:15,143 --> 00:37:16,779
What happened to your leg?

414
00:37:21,921 --> 00:37:23,982
I…

415
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:26,379
I was born with it.

416
00:37:27,957 --> 00:37:32,379
You are aware we do not accept the deformed into the infantry?

417
00:37:36,248 --> 00:37:38,382
I shall make an exception for you.

418
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:43,179
But you will take me back to that village.

419
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:46,779
By the order of The Council of Shamans,

420
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:49,179
I must arrest and interrogate that freak.

421
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,370
But… Sir…

422
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,980
Do you not want to be a soldier?

423
00:38:05,257 --> 00:38:07,179
Can you promise me

424
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,579
that my brother will not be harmed?

425
00:38:10,385 --> 00:38:11,979
Expel him if you must.

426
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:16,779
Very well.

427
00:38:17,157 --> 00:38:19,179
If you get me in the village,

428
00:38:20,208 --> 00:38:21,580
I shall beg the Lord’s pardon

429
00:38:22,268 --> 00:38:23,979
and your brother will be spared.

430
00:38:24,438 --> 00:38:26,379
Do we have an agreement?

431
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:39,259
No.

432
00:38:44,342 --> 00:38:46,567
If you get me in the village,

433
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:48,207
I shall beg the Lord’s pardon

434
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:49,868
and your brother will be spared.

435
00:38:49,868 --> 00:38:50,986
Do we have an agreement?

436
00:38:50,986 --> 00:38:51,900
No.

437
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,777
No!

438
00:38:53,468 --> 00:38:55,180
I shall beg the Lord’s pardon

439
00:38:56,026 --> 00:38:57,579
and your brother will be spared.

440
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,287
Do we have an agreement?

441
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,180
We freaking don’t.

442
00:39:01,462 --> 00:39:03,579
I won’t let it happen again.

443
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,979
You can’t change it.

444
00:39:06,251 --> 00:39:08,379
It’s already happened.

445
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:09,813
So…

446
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:11,081
Just accept it.

447
00:39:11,081 --> 00:39:11,980
No.

448
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:14,379
I won’t.

449
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:16,779
I won’t lead them into the village.

450
00:39:16,779 --> 00:39:18,958
Your brother will be spared.

451
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:20,382
Do we have an agreement?

452
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,979
What exactly…

453
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:26,377
was your answer that day?

454
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:33,579
If you get me in the village,

455
00:39:33,965 --> 00:39:35,845
I shall beg the Lord’s pardon

456
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:37,845
and your brother will be spared.

457
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,579
Do we have an agreement?

458
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:57,579
Yes.

459
00:39:58,525 --> 00:39:59,979
I shall take you there.

460
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,280
Do not leave anyone behind!

461
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,791
No…

462
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:17,979
Walk.

463
00:40:27,402 --> 00:40:30,641
Tie the freak to the stake.

464
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:31,920
Sir.

465
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:34,779
Do–Do not take my brother.

466
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:41,602
Forward.

467
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:43,122
Come here.

468
00:40:43,122 --> 00:40:44,380
Chan.

469
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:46,780
- Walk! - Chan.

470
00:40:47,115 --> 00:40:47,982
Chan!

471
00:40:58,063 --> 00:40:59,426
Go! Run!

472
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:02,920
Stop!

473
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,776
Stop!

474
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,979
Stop!

475
00:41:07,979 --> 00:41:09,579
June.

476
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,179
I’m sorry.

477
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,979
I’m sorry for everything.

478
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:21,103
I’m sorry about Bam,

479
00:41:22,845 --> 00:41:23,979
and about Triphob.

480
00:41:26,471 --> 00:41:28,133
I’m really sorry.

481
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:29,826
I’m sorry.

482
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:31,182
Khatha.

483
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,608
Get out of here.

484
00:41:37,845 --> 00:41:39,582
Run as far as you can.

485
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:41,582
Go!

486
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,109
The One!

487
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:56,379
Please…

488
00:41:57,866 --> 00:41:59,410
Stop this.

489
00:42:02,377 --> 00:42:04,256
I’m begging you.

490
00:42:10,417 --> 00:42:12,382
I surrender.

491
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:17,979
It was my fault.

492
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:23,980
The One!

493
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:29,979
One last question…

494
00:42:30,764 --> 00:42:32,380
Who killed the witch?

495
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:49,179
I did.

496
00:42:52,875 --> 00:42:54,520
I killed the witch.

497
00:42:59,554 --> 00:43:01,179
I killed my brother.

498
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,579
Ding-ding!

499
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:23,979
I curse you

500
00:43:24,448 --> 00:43:27,579
to an eternity of suffering.

501
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:29,976
I curse you

502
00:43:30,376 --> 00:43:33,579
to stand there and witness all the pain you have caused me.

503
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,979
I curse you

504
00:43:36,388 --> 00:43:38,949
to drown in the sin of your own making,

505
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,776
endlessly,

506
00:43:42,074 --> 00:43:44,377
until the sun turns into darkness,

507
00:43:44,634 --> 00:43:46,779
the moon into blood,

508
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:51,580
and the stars into rubbles raining down upon earth.

509
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:53,800
And then I will return

510
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,379
to destroy everything you ever have!

511
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:34,779
Why are you doing this?

512
00:44:36,232 --> 00:44:38,379
Why are you putting me through this again?

513
00:44:43,506 --> 00:44:46,777
You put yourself through it all.

514
00:44:47,948 --> 00:44:49,179
Yeah, yeah.

515
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:51,579
You were a traitor in the past.

516
00:44:51,927 --> 00:44:55,808
And you are about to repeat the same mistake

517
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:57,580
with them.

518
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:10,530
Chan knew you didn’t mean for it to happen.

519
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:12,574
Chan knew why you did what you did.

520
00:45:12,574 --> 00:45:14,379
He just couldn’t forgive you.

521
00:45:16,983 --> 00:45:20,001
Don’t hope for something that will never come.

522
00:45:20,001 --> 00:45:22,417
Don’t betray what you already have.

523
00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:24,976
Because if you made the same mistake again,

524
00:45:24,976 --> 00:45:28,779
the deaths you saw today might actually come to pass.

525
00:45:29,232 --> 00:45:32,841
As of today, Triphob is alive. So are Bam and June.

526
00:45:32,841 --> 00:45:34,782
So is Dome.

527
00:45:37,444 --> 00:45:39,582
Where… Where is Dome right now?

528
00:45:39,915 --> 00:45:41,077
Nowhere too far.

529
00:45:41,077 --> 00:45:42,648
But like I said…

530
00:45:42,648 --> 00:45:45,580
Here, but not right here.

531
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,488
He can’t be there too long.

532
00:45:47,488 --> 00:45:49,179
That place is way too close to death.

533
00:45:49,491 --> 00:45:51,579
But you have to be the one who gets him out.

534
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,757
You’re going to need one thing, though…

535
00:45:54,757 --> 00:45:56,377
The key.

536
00:45:57,318 --> 00:45:58,777
What key?

537
00:45:58,965 --> 00:45:59,977
Huh?

538
00:46:00,586 --> 00:46:01,977
What key?

539
00:46:02,314 --> 00:46:02,942
What—

540
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,780
Oww, Oww, Oww.

541
00:46:18,998 --> 00:46:21,579
People in this era are as brittle as twigs.

542
00:46:24,814 --> 00:46:26,349
The One…

543
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,177
He’s the key.

544
00:46:32,614 --> 00:46:33,579
And you…

545
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:36,706
You need to solve the puzzle.

546
00:46:44,382 --> 00:46:45,579
Poor Khatha…

547
00:46:48,114 --> 00:46:50,379
Something grand is waiting for you.

548
00:46:52,173 --> 00:46:53,979
Don’t cry.

549
00:46:55,265 --> 00:46:56,379
Keep in mind

550
00:46:58,540 --> 00:46:59,979
that you are…

551
00:47:01,625 --> 00:47:03,579
an important pawn for me in this game.

552
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:23,980
Let’s hope we never see each other again, guys.

00:48:11,986 --> 00:48:13,180
I’m in The Limbo!

558
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,377
Dome?

559
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:17,577
Do you remember the telephone?

560
00:48:17,577 --> 00:48:18,780
Of course.

561
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:21,814
I thought I could save the man I loved,

562
00:48:21,925 --> 00:48:23,977
but I only ended up hurting him even more.

563
00:48:23,977 --> 00:48:25,762
I don’t know where Dome is.

564
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:27,487
But I will get him back.

565
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,780
If I can control it,

566
00:48:29,337 --> 00:48:30,988
I can use it to open the portal,

567
00:48:30,988 --> 00:48:32,382
and bring Dome back.
