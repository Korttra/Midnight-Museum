1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:02,379
You will be in this state for a while.

2
00:00:03,031 --> 00:00:06,019
Until the power of the rock completely withdraws from you.

3
00:00:06,293 --> 00:00:08,419
In the upcoming auction,

4
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,817
we need to get that item.

5
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,419
Every woman dreams of being the picture of perfection.

6
00:00:41,288 --> 00:00:43,219
But being perfect,

7
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,620
it comes with a cost.

8
00:01:09,724 --> 00:01:12,019
Why are you taking Mom's photo down?

9
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:30,611
Bee, please have breakfast.

10
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,804
No.

11
00:01:33,699 --> 00:01:34,779
Bee.

12
00:01:35,122 --> 00:01:36,020
Come back here.

13
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:38,420
Bee, come here.

14
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:44,379
Just to be the perfect woman...

15
00:01:49,656 --> 00:01:52,183
What on earth brought me here?

16
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,930
Tor Thanaphob

23
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,422
Dome.

24
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,508
Will you please eat something?

25
00:03:30,262 --> 00:03:32,419
He's still not eating?

26
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,019
I'll be gone for a few days.

27
00:03:42,438 --> 00:03:44,419
I leave Dome in your care.

28
00:03:47,044 --> 00:03:49,217
The item you're going to the auction for...

29
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,619
It will really help Dome, won't it?

30
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,619
Oh, look.

31
00:04:21,986 --> 00:04:22,819
Excuse me.

32
00:04:23,595 --> 00:04:25,829
You're Ing, the new resident, right?

33
00:04:27,062 --> 00:04:28,779
Nice to meet you.

34
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:30,647
I'm Manee.

35
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:33,579
This is Chinda and Ploy.

36
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:38,247
We happened to see you and Mr. Kong just now.

37
00:04:38,247 --> 00:04:40,392
You were adorable.

38
00:04:40,392 --> 00:04:41,219
You totally are.

39
00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:43,494
Reminds me of way back.

40
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:48,146
Budsara used to give Mr. Kong a kiss goodbye before work, too.

41
00:04:48,451 --> 00:04:53,650
I wonder what happened between them that made Budsara...

42
00:05:34,096 --> 00:05:36,825
We'll stay in this position for three breaths.

43
00:05:36,825 --> 00:05:38,422
Keep your right knee soft.

44
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,545
Chest open and eyes to the ceiling.

45
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:43,219
Three.... Take a deep breath.

46
00:05:43,994 --> 00:05:48,019
Two... Keep your right foot on the mat.

47
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:49,179
One...

48
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,478
(She looked like she was competing with someone.)

49
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:52,656
(Guess it's in her nature to always fight)

50
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:54,400
(...for someone else's seat at the table.)

51
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,585
(You need to keep an eye on your husband, you know?)

52
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,593
(He would never want the lowlife of a woman)

53
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:03,603
(...so eager to enter high society.)

54
00:06:15,026 --> 00:06:16,207
Thank you.

55
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,712
Thank you.

56
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:23,342
You are...

57
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,508
I'm Nisa.

58
00:06:24,508 --> 00:06:26,419
Thank you, Nisa.

59
00:06:26,825 --> 00:06:29,980
Was it your first time trying yoga, Ing?

60
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:31,217
Yes, it was.

61
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,779
So it was. And you did such a good job.

62
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:36,779
Thank you.

63
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:39,579
I didn't want to hold anyone back so I tried my best.

64
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:43,388
I've heard so much about you,

65
00:06:43,388 --> 00:06:45,235
but you're nothing like what they all said.

66
00:06:45,528 --> 00:06:46,779
People talked?

67
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,096
Well...

68
00:06:52,728 --> 00:06:55,382
Nisa, you're here, too?

69
00:06:55,382 --> 00:06:57,619
We didn't see you in class at all.

70
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:58,780
Right?

71
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,745
I've been here the entire time.

72
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,979
But you probably didn't see me because

73
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:08,980
you were so busy nitpicking someone else.

74
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:11,660
Oh, no way.

75
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:14,420
I was just looking at Ing

76
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:18,065
because she looked really enthusiastic and determined.

77
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,413
She totally was.

78
00:07:19,413 --> 00:07:21,619
I thought the exact word was "eager"?

79
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:26,419
I think I heard something like "eager to enter high society."

80
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,106
No way.

81
00:07:29,106 --> 00:07:31,217
I think you might have misheard that, Ing.

82
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:33,217
It's about time we leave.

83
00:07:33,217 --> 00:07:34,503
Our kids must be waiting.

84
00:07:35,013 --> 00:07:36,117
That's true.

85
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:38,077
We have to go pick up our babies.

86
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,518
Excuse us.

87
00:07:40,518 --> 00:07:41,979
Let's go.

88
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:46,305
I didn't take you for someone who bites back, Ing.

89
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:51,580
Don't you have to pick up your children, too?

90
00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:56,379
I don't have children.

91
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:01,451
Well, then.

92
00:08:01,451 --> 00:08:03,579
Do you want to come to my place to talk some more?

93
00:08:03,905 --> 00:08:06,608
I'd love to get to know more about you.

94
00:08:30,882 --> 00:08:32,380
Here, Mr. Khatha.

95
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:59,565
(Your visit is very welcome, esteemed guests.)

96
00:08:59,565 --> 00:09:03,103
(The first day of our auction starts at exactly noon.)

97
00:09:03,103 --> 00:09:07,152
(The guests interested in auctioning these pieces,)

98
00:09:07,152 --> 00:09:10,207
(please attend the auction at the hotel's library.)

99
00:09:10,382 --> 00:09:13,850
(You are to bring the auction card we have provided)

100
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:16,330
(in place of your credit card.)

101
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,377
(Have a good day and may you bring home the very things you came for.)

102
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:23,305
Mr. Khatha.

103
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,817
The item we want is the last piece to be auctioned off on the last day.

104
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:30,605
Is that so?

105
00:09:33,174 --> 00:09:35,274
Well, until then,

106
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:38,245
if there's any other pieces you want for the museum,

107
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,579
feel free to go for it.

108
00:09:39,896 --> 00:09:41,157
Like that pearl egg thing you like so much—

109
00:09:41,157 --> 00:09:42,601
The Fabergé egg.

110
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:44,657
That.

111
00:09:44,657 --> 00:09:46,779
I think I'll take a rest.

112
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:48,651
You can use my card.

113
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:49,909
Thank you.

114
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,820
But I've got mine.

115
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,820
Excuse me.

116
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,579
That brat....

117
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:07,219
So he came prepared, huh.

118
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,779
Please, come in.

119
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:55,805
Feel free to take a seat.

120
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:22,277
A hot soup after a workout soothes the body and the mind.

121
00:11:22,277 --> 00:11:23,512
Thank you.

122
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,401
Don't worry yourself about those people, Ing.

123
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,219
They're just jealous.

124
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:35,385
You got to marry the handsome and rich Mr. Kong,

125
00:11:35,385 --> 00:11:37,050
and he's young, too.

126
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:40,281
Us women are driven by envy, after all.

127
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:41,979
Don't you think so, Ing?

128
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:49,219
Actually, every family has their own problems.

129
00:11:50,659 --> 00:11:54,019
Manee just caught her husband cheating,

130
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,078
but she's turning a blind eye.

131
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,219
Chinda's and Ploy's husbands are secretly fooling around.

132
00:12:02,477 --> 00:12:04,782
How come you know everything?

133
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,419
It's probably because...

134
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:11,459
I live above everyone.

135
00:12:12,244 --> 00:12:15,619
The higher it is, the more I can see.

136
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:21,579
I can even see someone who jumps off the top floor.

137
00:12:23,053 --> 00:12:24,654
But you don't need to worry.

138
00:12:25,242 --> 00:12:28,782
I don't care what other people's stories are.

139
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:35,653
I simply think you and Mr. Kong are perfect for each other,

140
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,653
because you're such a strong woman.

141
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:39,620
One issue, though.

142
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:42,605
Too bad he already has a child.

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,580
He'll definitely put his daughter first.

144
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:51,619
I bet he's already started to feel a little distant, hasn't he?

145
00:12:54,386 --> 00:12:56,419
Let me be frank with you...

146
00:12:57,016 --> 00:12:59,980
When was the last time you two slept together?

147
00:13:02,725 --> 00:13:04,779
Don't tell me it's even before the wedding.

148
00:13:08,478 --> 00:13:09,580
How is that funny?

149
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:12,468
Excuse me.

150
00:13:12,468 --> 00:13:14,280
What do you want?

151
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,542
Try the soup.

152
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:16,841
That's not what I'm talking about—

153
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:18,017
Please try the soup.

154
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,807
What on earth did you put in this?

155
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,019
This bag is full of charmed salt.

156
00:14:18,888 --> 00:14:21,579
It will give you everything you ever want.

157
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:25,850
(Ever heard of the phrase...)

158
00:14:25,875 --> 00:14:28,099
("The way to a man's heart is through his stomach"?)

159
00:14:28,124 --> 00:14:30,017
(It might sound a little medieval,)

160
00:14:30,182 --> 00:14:31,932
(but after getting married,

161
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:35,594
I learned that it also means something else.)

162
00:14:35,619 --> 00:14:37,219
You're home?

163
00:14:38,823 --> 00:14:39,957
Bee.

164
00:14:45,037 --> 00:14:50,379
(It means power and control.)

165
00:15:01,364 --> 00:15:04,297
(And you can have it via your cooking.)

166
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:10,777
Try it and see if you like it.

167
00:15:26,998 --> 00:15:28,202
It's good.

168
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,103
You like it?

169
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:30,751
Can I have more?

170
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:31,859
Of course.

171
00:15:33,623 --> 00:15:36,551
(In olden times, us women didn't get to study.)

172
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:38,899
(We were thrown in the kitchen very early on in life.)

173
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:40,448
(We were diminished,)

174
00:15:40,448 --> 00:15:42,865
(deprived of actually doing something that matters.)

175
00:15:42,865 --> 00:15:45,619
(Having opinions and desires was not an option.)

176
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:49,819
(But there was still one thing we could do,)

177
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:53,979
and that was indirectly having control over those in power.

178
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:56,380
Ing.

179
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:08,379
I love you, Ing.

180
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,065
I love you, too.

181
00:16:17,773 --> 00:16:22,257
(If there's something we can do to control such power,)

182
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:26,217
(even if the chances are slim,)

183
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:28,217
(it is worth trying, isn't it?)

184
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,619
Why are you just sitting there?

185
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:53,405
Don't know how to play?

186
00:16:56,207 --> 00:16:57,579
You don't have to care.

187
00:16:58,131 --> 00:17:01,219
Even if I played, no one would anyway.

188
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:05,274
So you're saying you can play, or you could,

189
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,179
but you don't know how anymore?

190
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,819
Musician's sense, I guess.

191
00:17:11,965 --> 00:17:14,379
I'm a piano teacher. My name's Ratchanee.

192
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:25,219
Let me see.

193
00:17:29,844 --> 00:17:31,804
Musician's dystonia.

194
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:36,680
That doesn't happen to all musicians.

195
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,579
Only to those who play a lot, who practice a lot.

196
00:17:40,278 --> 00:17:41,976
Some understand that

197
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:46,253
it is caused by vigorous or bad practice.

198
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,831
But what many don't know is that

199
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:50,419
someone with this condition

200
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:54,804
can't control their own muscles because of anxiety.

201
00:17:54,804 --> 00:17:57,008
In someone who's a perfectionist,

202
00:17:57,623 --> 00:17:59,509
it could be even worse.

203
00:18:03,318 --> 00:18:04,820
Is there a solution

204
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,853
to what you just described?

205
00:18:30,562 --> 00:18:32,420
Do you want to try again?

206
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:34,820
I actually charge an hourly fee.

207
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,219
We start practicing at 6PM.

208
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:40,306
I'm not sure if I want to learn.

209
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,807
That's not a definite no, is it?

210
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,217
Believe me

211
00:19:53,202 --> 00:19:55,179
and everyone will look at you again.

212
00:20:41,628 --> 00:20:42,328
Who are you?

213
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,013
Bee?

214
00:20:43,013 --> 00:20:44,708
I'm not playing with you, Bee!

215
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,105
Let me go!

216
00:21:02,736 --> 00:21:03,620
Bee?

217
00:21:04,457 --> 00:21:06,019
Were you in the room with me?

218
00:21:07,518 --> 00:21:08,420
No.

219
00:21:09,508 --> 00:21:10,484
What?

220
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:12,634
You look like you just saw a ghost.

221
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,207
Or is there actually one in there?

222
00:21:30,194 --> 00:21:30,702
Bee...

223
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:33,579
Why is my mother's photo here?

224
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,911
Listen to me, Bee.

225
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:38,770
Why should I listen to the person who stole Dad away from Mom and me?

226
00:21:39,034 --> 00:21:40,792
- Bee, calm down. - Do you realize...

227
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,635
-You're the reason my mother killed herself?

228
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,322
Do you?

229
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:47,979
Don't ever think you could replace her.

230
00:21:48,237 --> 00:21:52,308
A bitch like you will never take her place.

231
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:53,163
Bee!

232
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:56,419
How could you say that?

233
00:21:58,328 --> 00:21:59,980
Apologize right now.

234
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:02,287
No.

235
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,213
Apologize.

236
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:04,047
No!

237
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,706
Kong, no.

238
00:22:07,223 --> 00:22:08,106
Bee.

239
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:09,908
Bee.

240
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:11,921
Bee.

241
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:14,376
Please, don't fight. Bee, I'm sorry.

242
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,540
Bee, I'm sorry.

243
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:21,619
Bee.

244
00:22:22,548 --> 00:22:24,549
Bee, I'm sorry.

245
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,245
Bee, I'm really sorry.

246
00:22:27,251 --> 00:22:29,402
I didn't mean for it to be like this.

247
00:22:39,023 --> 00:22:41,979
Kong, she was right.

248
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:45,035
Bud really died because of me.

249
00:22:45,035 --> 00:22:49,177
She was so good to me and I shouldn't have done this to her.

250
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,419
You didn't.

251
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:52,106
Ing, listen to me.

252
00:22:52,823 --> 00:22:54,607
Bud and I didn't love each other anymore.

253
00:22:55,155 --> 00:22:57,619
We were already going to get a divorce, Ing.

254
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:01,604
But Bee was really close to her mother.

255
00:23:01,604 --> 00:23:04,019
She needed someone to blame

256
00:23:04,044 --> 00:23:07,253
so she could easily accept her loss.

257
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:09,001
Do you understand?

258
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:12,880
Ing.

259
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:15,368
Ing.

260
00:23:15,368 --> 00:23:16,817
Be patient.

261
00:23:17,383 --> 00:23:18,512
Alright?

262
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:20,379
Be patient.

263
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:22,779
We'll finally be a perfect family.

264
00:23:23,317 --> 00:23:24,706
Alright?

265
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:27,577
I love you, Ing.

266
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:31,219
I love you, too.

267
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,617
Miss Ratchanee?

268
00:24:38,693 --> 00:24:40,207
I'm ready.

269
00:25:00,734 --> 00:25:01,702
Miss...

270
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,819
What do I do now?

271
00:25:07,225 --> 00:25:09,619
What you need to do is...

272
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:12,019
Try this.

273
00:25:19,032 --> 00:25:20,637
(Swallow your pride)

274
00:25:20,637 --> 00:25:22,779
(and eat the soup made by the woman you hate.)

275
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:44,380
Can I have seconds?

276
00:26:56,202 --> 00:26:57,456
Thank you.

277
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:15,579
Excuse me, Nisa.

278
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:20,337
I saw that you have a little tip for Ing.

279
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:22,779
We would like to have it, too.

280
00:27:22,965 --> 00:27:24,702
Would you mind sharing?

281
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:32,582
Mr. Khatha.

282
00:27:32,582 --> 00:27:35,600
I think we have something to be concerned about at this auction.

283
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,179
These past three days,

284
00:27:37,457 --> 00:27:40,819
someone always beat us to every single piece we wanted to buy.

285
00:27:55,481 --> 00:27:57,623
Maybe you only hold a grudge against this person

286
00:27:57,623 --> 00:28:00,019
because she bought the piece you wanted?

287
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:02,019
No.

288
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:04,493
I seriously think the situation isn't looking good.

289
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:08,377
It's like she's here to buy every piece at this auction.

290
00:28:08,678 --> 00:28:11,682
If that's the case, the item that you want...

291
00:28:11,682 --> 00:28:13,908
You speak like you don't know me, Triphob.

292
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:19,220
I will definitely get what I want.

293
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,382
Don't worry.

294
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:31,219
But I'm getting really curious who The High Priestess is.

295
00:28:48,297 --> 00:28:50,422
Let me buy you this drink.

296
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,819
What's the occasion?

297
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,217
Let's just say I...

298
00:28:56,331 --> 00:28:57,619
would love to know you.

299
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:11,408
I thought there's a rule that doesn't allow us to reveal who we are.

300
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:17,979
I didn't take you for someone who cares about rules.

301
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:22,272
They also don't allow us to buy more than 10 pieces at a time,

302
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:24,608
and you don't seem to care about that.

303
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,208
So that's what this is actually about.

304
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:33,619
Then I guess I really don't care about rules just like you suggested.

305
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,586
Tell me honestly what you want.

306
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:41,508
I'd love to know, too, what exactly you want from this auction.

307
00:29:43,179 --> 00:29:44,379
The reason is personal.

308
00:29:47,774 --> 00:29:49,814
But you look like you're intimidated by me.

309
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:55,610
Is there something you need?

310
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:57,004
You can tell me.

311
00:29:57,377 --> 00:29:58,782
I'll let you have it

312
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:01,810
as a token of my gratitude for buying me a drink.

313
00:30:07,438 --> 00:30:09,620
How about we just see how it will go at the actual auction?

314
00:30:22,308 --> 00:30:25,180
Then at least let me buy you this drink in return.

315
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:28,305
As for the auction, I accept your challenge.

316
00:30:29,355 --> 00:30:31,222
Whatever it is that you want,

317
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,619
I will make it mine.

318
00:30:35,647 --> 00:30:37,179
See you there...

319
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,822
Mr. Museum Owner.

320
00:31:36,863 --> 00:31:37,903
Mr. Khatha.

321
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:39,577
Everything's in order.

322
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,207
Good evening.

323
00:32:20,207 --> 00:32:25,179
Welcome our esteemed guests to the last day of the auction.

324
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:29,979
And the first piece of tonight is...

325
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:34,779
The Royal Danish, also known as the lost Fabergé egg.

326
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:40,820
The price starts at 100 million USD.

327
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,982
We are ready for bidding.

328
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:43,854
Triphob.

329
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:46,204
I'll avenge you.

330
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,020
(I'm counting on you, sir.)

331
00:32:54,897 --> 00:33:01,182
Our first bid is 150 million USD by The Hermit.

332
00:33:02,426 --> 00:33:08,379
I now have 200 million USD from The High Priestess.

333
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,782
Anyone wants to go higher?

334
00:33:15,583 --> 00:33:17,977
We are currently at 250 million USD.

335
00:33:20,379 --> 00:33:22,779
300 million USD now.

336
00:33:26,727 --> 00:33:27,579
(Mr. Khatha.)

337
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:29,979
(We should let this one go.)

338
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:32,597
I'll get over the Fabergé egg.

339
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,777
Going once.

340
00:33:35,614 --> 00:33:37,179
Going twice.

341
00:33:38,284 --> 00:33:40,202
And sold!

342
00:33:40,634 --> 00:33:44,379
The Royal Danish is sold to The High Priestess!

343
00:33:47,062 --> 00:33:49,179
The next piece is just as interesting:

344
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,217
Sunflower No.2 by one famous painter.

345
00:33:55,545 --> 00:34:01,105
We start the bidding at 100 million USD,

346
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:01,909
starting now.

347
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:06,705
Mr. Khatha, there is no authentication on this painting yet.

348
00:34:07,294 --> 00:34:08,915
It could be a forgery.

349
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,035
(I know.)

350
00:34:10,183 --> 00:34:12,807
Only fools would risk their fortune and buy something like this.

351
00:34:12,807 --> 00:34:15,579
I have a 200 million USD bid.

352
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:17,979
Anyone else wants to go higher?

353
00:34:19,965 --> 00:34:21,308
(Don't be that fool, sir.)

354
00:34:21,515 --> 00:34:22,779
Shut up.

355
00:34:24,518 --> 00:34:27,579
We're now at 300 million USD.

356
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:29,408
Anyone else?

357
00:34:31,454 --> 00:34:33,620
Going once.

358
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,020
Going twice.

359
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:39,401
And sold!

360
00:34:39,401 --> 00:34:43,217
The Sunflower is sold to The Hermit.

361
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:44,379
(Mr. Khatha.)

362
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:46,779
Triphob, keep quiet.

363
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:49,182
I'm getting fired up.

364
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:52,037
Sold to The Hermit!

365
00:34:52,205 --> 00:34:53,977
Sold to The High Priestess!

366
00:34:54,213 --> 00:34:55,774
Sold to The Hermit!

367
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:57,139
Sold to The High Priestess!

368
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,303
Congratulations.

369
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:05,921
The next piece is an ancient crystal jewelry made of salt crystal

370
00:35:05,921 --> 00:35:08,100
formerly belonging to an onmyoji from the Heian period.

371
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,600
It comes with purifying power and is said to absorb negative energy.

372
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,579
The purer it is, the more power it holds.

373
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:21,622
We start the bidding at 500 million USD, starting now.

374
00:35:24,567 --> 00:35:28,819
I have one billion USD.

375
00:35:31,681 --> 00:35:34,106
Two billion USD.

376
00:35:34,106 --> 00:35:36,020
Any higher?

377
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,305
(Mr. Khatha,)

378
00:35:40,648 --> 00:35:42,607
can I say something?

379
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:45,620
Since when did you ask for permission to speak?

380
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:48,019
You always just chatter away.

381
00:35:49,054 --> 00:35:53,413
I feel that lately Mr. Dome has come to have such an influence on you.

382
00:35:54,096 --> 00:35:57,619
(It could be because he looks like your younger brother,)

383
00:35:57,891 --> 00:36:01,180
but I don't want you to get attached to Mr. Dome.

384
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,405
The world we live in is full of danger.

385
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:09,005
(That means Mr. Dome is certain to face such danger, too.)

386
00:36:09,854 --> 00:36:12,022
And if you were to lose Mr. Dome, too,

387
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:16,205
I do hope you wouldn't do something stupid.

388
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,779
Three billion dollars.

389
00:36:27,134 --> 00:36:28,819
What do you mean?

390
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,610
(I know you'll do anything to save him.)

391
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:34,777
So do it.

392
00:36:38,284 --> 00:36:39,909
Thank you, Triphob.

393
00:36:48,371 --> 00:36:52,749
And the current bid is at three billion USD.

394
00:36:52,749 --> 00:36:54,605
Does anyone want to go higher?

395
00:36:55,484 --> 00:36:57,620
Going once.

396
00:36:57,842 --> 00:36:59,506
Going twice.

397
00:37:01,065 --> 00:37:02,906
And sold!

398
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:10,560
The ancient crystal jewelry is sold to The Hermit at three billion USD.

399
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,423
Tonight's auction has come to an end.

400
00:37:13,423 --> 00:37:14,481
We hope to see you again.

401
00:37:14,481 --> 00:37:16,402
Thank you and goodnight.

402
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,263
(The Book of Revelation)

403
00:37:51,263 --> 00:37:53,330
I am the singer of praises of the Lord. (The Book of Revelation)

404
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,019
I am the singer of praises of the Lord.

405
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,979
I am waiting, for the Lord shall show wonders in heavens and earth:

406
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,840
blood

407
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:03,620
and fire

408
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:04,779
and pillars of smoke.

409
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:11,405
The sun shall be turned into darkness,

410
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:13,808
the moon into blood,

411
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:18,019
and the stars into rubbles raining down upon earth,

412
00:38:19,717 --> 00:38:21,577
before the coming of the great

413
00:38:22,357 --> 00:38:25,219
and terrible day of the Lord.

414
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:35,589
(I got what I wanted.)

415
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:38,114
(So I'm giving you this.)

416
00:38:38,114 --> 00:38:40,336
(If there's anything else I need in the future,)

417
00:38:40,336 --> 00:38:42,530
(I'll be sure to take it over from you.)

418
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:15,619
What's for lunch?

419
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,367
I		I can't tell you. It's a surprise.

420
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:20,419
Sit down. Food will be ready soon.

421
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:21,577
Okay.

422
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,490
(Boarding school massacre brought by oppressive seniority system)

423
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:42,608
Is something wrong?

424
00:39:45,317 --> 00:39:46,490
Not at all.

425
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:48,019
Go sit down. Food will be ready soon.

426
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:52,108
I'll wait.

427
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:53,979
I'm starving.

428
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:00,608
It looks amazing.

429
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,708
Why does it taste weird?

430
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:16,819
It's not your usual flavor.

431
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:19,220
I feel like something is missing.

432
00:40:20,032 --> 00:40:21,617
Maybe you should make something else?

433
00:40:22,684 --> 00:40:24,542
We ran out of ingredients.

434
00:40:24,542 --> 00:40:26,419
We can buy more.

435
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:28,109
Here's the money.

436
00:40:28,454 --> 00:40:29,980
It's...

437
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:31,348
Take it, Ing.

438
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:32,380
Take my money.

439
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,238
Take everything.

440
00:40:33,238 --> 00:40:34,755
Please cook it again.

441
00:40:34,755 --> 00:40:37,398
If that's not enough, just take my watch.

442
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:38,419
Ing!

443
00:40:38,647 --> 00:40:40,077
Cook something!

444
00:40:40,077 --> 00:40:41,244
Go buy some ingredients.

445
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:43,035
Ing, cook!

446
00:40:43,035 --> 00:40:43,888
Alright!

447
00:40:43,888 --> 00:40:45,050
Alright, everyone.

448
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,300
I said alright.

449
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:47,143
Nisa, are you there?

450
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:48,022
Open the door.

451
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:49,909
Are you in there?

452
00:40:50,266 --> 00:40:51,478
She's not answering.

453
00:40:51,478 --> 00:40:52,819
Where is she?

454
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:53,955
Nisa!

455
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,395
Come here, Ing.

456
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:56,377
Where's Nisa?

457
00:40:56,377 --> 00:40:57,645
It's your fault, Ing.

458
00:40:57,645 --> 00:40:59,318
We started using that salt because of you.

459
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:00,204
Nisa, are you there?

460
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:01,724
Say something!

461
00:41:02,533 --> 00:41:03,617
Hey, look!

462
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,379
Let go!

463
00:41:12,238 --> 00:41:13,216
Let go!

464
00:42:12,823 --> 00:42:14,419
Oh, Ing?

465
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:16,819
Why don't you join me?

466
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:25,180
Human flesh isn't bad, you know?

467
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:31,222
Would you like to try?

468
00:42:38,903 --> 00:42:40,306
What do you want?

469
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:43,114
Why did you do this to my family?

470
00:42:43,114 --> 00:42:45,114
I'm here to help you.

471
00:42:46,933 --> 00:42:48,700
We are good friends

472
00:42:50,362 --> 00:42:53,408
so I want to share with you the secret recipe for the salt.

473
00:42:53,761 --> 00:42:56,379
To make someone happy,

474
00:42:57,419 --> 00:43:00,017
it costs someone else's tears.

475
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,979
It's not surprising, is it, that this charmed salt is made of the tears

476
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,620
of someone who's in the worst pain of their life?

477
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,019
It's a top-shelf seasoning.

478
00:43:12,731 --> 00:43:16,819
But Ing, whose tears should it be?

479
00:43:17,885 --> 00:43:19,690
The recipe never specifies

480
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:22,202
if it has to be the tears of someone you love,

481
00:43:22,202 --> 00:43:24,622
the tears of someone you hate,

482
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:28,207
or the tears of someone you truly do not need.

483
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:32,380
Someone like your stepdaughter.

484
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:45,496
Get a tight grip on this knife

485
00:43:45,496 --> 00:43:50,422
and drive it into someone you really want to disappear.

486
00:44:24,468 --> 00:44:28,204
It seems your stepdaughter really relishes her father's flesh.

487
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:30,019
She can't stop eating.

488
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:31,179
You.

489
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:34,819
This is all your fault.

490
00:44:35,802 --> 00:44:38,380
You took Dad away from Mom and me.

491
00:44:39,106 --> 00:44:41,408
You're the reason Mom killed herself.

492
00:44:42,865 --> 00:44:45,869
Someone like you is only fit to be my maid,

493
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:47,979
not my mother.

494
00:44:49,992 --> 00:44:51,109
Oh?

495
00:44:52,171 --> 00:44:53,506
I get it now.

496
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:57,580
Then let's settle it right here right now.

497
00:45:19,545 --> 00:45:21,920
You ruined my perfect life!

498
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,379
It's you who took everything from me.

499
00:45:24,379 --> 00:45:26,816
You robbed me of my perfection!

500
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:59,979
Pain...

501
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:03,005
It always tastes so sweet on the victor's tongue.

502
00:46:15,925 --> 00:46:17,405
I guess yours won.

503
00:46:41,084 --> 00:46:43,177
I'll let you in on one last tip.

504
00:46:53,869 --> 00:46:57,580
Being a woman is difficult.

505
00:46:58,558 --> 00:47:01,217
You have so many duties to do.

506
00:47:02,616 --> 00:47:04,779
Be a good wife.

507
00:47:15,367 --> 00:47:17,508
Be a good role model.

508
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:30,650
Be a good leader.

509
00:47:59,315 --> 00:48:03,619
It's not easy for one woman to have it all.

510
00:48:40,672 --> 00:48:44,422
In due time, the resurrection will be upon us.

511
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:11,979
How are you feeling?

512
00:49:13,063 --> 00:49:14,379
I'm alright now.

513
00:49:16,152 --> 00:49:18,605
June told me you've been trying to find a way to help me.

514
00:49:19,337 --> 00:49:20,422
Thank you.

515
00:49:29,494 --> 00:49:32,420
This jewelry is made of salt crystal.

516
00:49:33,688 --> 00:49:35,976
Old tales said salt is pure.

517
00:49:38,174 --> 00:49:42,020
It has the ability to drive away and absorb vile energy.

518
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,217
You have to wear it at all times.

519
00:50:03,164 --> 00:50:04,779
Do not ever take it off.

520
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,903
Is it expensive?

521
00:50:10,725 --> 00:50:13,222
Let's say it's not expensive enough to hurt my pocket.

522
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:15,619
That doesn't exactly answer my question.

523
00:50:15,885 --> 00:50:18,020
I don't even have a pocket to hurt.

524
00:50:27,955 --> 00:50:28,780
Dome.

525
00:50:31,982 --> 00:50:33,579
You're fired.

526
00:50:38,534 --> 00:50:40,780
Go back to your ordinary world.

527
00:50:42,466 --> 00:50:43,802
Don't ever come back.

528
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,377
You are no longer welcomed here.

529
00:51:04,705 --> 00:51:06,017
Here.

530
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:10,822
From now on,

531
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,219
you won't be able to find this place again.

532
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:31,179
I don't know what anyone else says,

533
00:51:31,893 --> 00:51:34,309
but I'll definitely come visit you, Dome.

I'm here to apply for a job.

541

Who are you?

542
00:53:34,032 --> 00:53:36,022
It doesn't matter who I am.

543
00:53:36,348 --> 00:53:37,906
Who are you?

544
00:53:40,429 --> 00:53:43,565
The crystal anklet Khatha said would protect you from anything,

545
00:53:43,565 --> 00:53:45,059
it doesn't work anymore.

546
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,600
That means

547
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,017
you're in danger.

548
00:53:48,826 --> 00:53:49,705
Dome!
