1
00:00:00,508 --> 00:00:01,219
Don’t!

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,770
Hey.

3
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:07,368
Dome!

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,052
You need to take responsibility for this.

5
00:00:17,444 --> 00:00:18,842
Kodoku.

6
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:21,368
It’s an ancient curse ritual used in Japan.

7
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:24,019
Animals were used in the ritual.

8
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,668
If you wanted a powerful curse,

9
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:31,182
You needed to use poisonous animals

10
00:00:31,207 --> 00:00:36,844
such as snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, and toads.

11
00:00:36,869 --> 00:00:39,445
Put the animals into a closed container.

12
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:42,537
Let them fight and kill one another.

13
00:00:43,522 --> 00:00:45,732
It’s believed that the last survivor

14
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:49,203
would become the most poisonous vindictive animal.

15
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,979
It would be ground into powder and used in the curse ritual.

16
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:56,921
Sometimes, it would be coated on weapons.

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,980
The poison would make the weapons more lethal.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,382
The curse would be put on the enemies.

19
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:23,980
Bro.

20
00:01:25,268 --> 00:01:27,287
Alright. Let’s go.

21
00:02:02,773 --> 00:02:03,579
Damn it.

22
00:02:03,842 --> 00:02:05,499
That was amazing.

23
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,177
I was so excited.

24
00:02:08,955 --> 00:02:10,066
By the way,

25
00:02:10,066 --> 00:02:13,179
When was the museum built on the land?

26
00:02:14,284 --> 00:02:15,480
That’s right.

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,636
I’ve been living in the neighborhood

28
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,331
since I was born but I’ve never seen it.

29
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:21,360
I don’t know.

30
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,582
I just know that they want some artifacts from the museum.

31
00:02:23,582 --> 00:02:26,379
The other stolen items besides the ones they want are our share.

32
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:28,779
We can share them among ourselves.

33
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,379
Damn. That’s cool.

34
00:02:33,656 --> 00:02:39,081
How much do these items worth in the market?

35
00:02:39,491 --> 00:02:42,976
These are haunted items that are wanted in the dark market.

36
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:44,976
This is its price.

37
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:48,608
Damn. 3 Million?!

38
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:50,604
3 Million?

39
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:51,854
Petch, let me take a look.

40
00:02:51,854 --> 00:02:53,022
What are you doing?

41
00:02:53,022 --> 00:02:54,894
Hey, hey, hey.

42
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:57,579
If you are haunted by the owner ghosts that want their items back,

43
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,979
You need to deal with them yourself.

44
00:03:04,743 --> 00:03:05,979
Hello.

45
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:08,379
What?

46
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:11,979
We are reaching the shortcut road to Pathum Thani.

47
00:03:12,477 --> 00:03:15,579
Alright. Just follow the navigator to the meeting point.

48
00:03:20,278 --> 00:03:21,579
Okay.

49
00:03:27,844 --> 00:03:32,379
The items that we stole are really haunted?

50
00:03:35,097 --> 00:03:37,340
Whether they are haunted or not,

51
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,444
you need to do your best in taking care of them.

52
00:03:39,444 --> 00:03:40,436
Don’t let any damage happen to them

53
00:03:40,461 --> 00:03:42,003
before they are delivered to the client.

54
00:03:42,072 --> 00:03:43,182
Otherwise, I will kill you.

55
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:45,106
Do you hear me?

56
00:03:48,204 --> 00:03:49,179
I got it.

57
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:53,979
Damn it.

58
00:03:54,737 --> 00:03:58,779
Without me, your robbery plan would never have been possible.

59
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:05,979
Damn it.

60
00:04:07,262 --> 00:04:09,579
If you are real, why don’t you get up and haunt me?

61
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:11,979
I’m not afraid of any damn ghosts.

62
00:04:15,491 --> 00:04:16,380
Ouch!

63
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,810
What the hell is that?

64
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:34,779
Turn around.

65
00:04:39,607 --> 00:04:40,490
What the heck?!

66
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:41,423
Turn around.

67
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,779
What the hell did he do?

68
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:22,237
Hey.

69
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,357
Get out.

70
00:05:33,112 --> 00:05:34,394
Nothing is damaged, isn’t it?

71
00:05:34,394 --> 00:05:35,594
Yes.

72
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:47,539
He said he will send a new truck tomorrow to pick up the artifacts.

73
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:49,182
Tomorrow?

74
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,002
Can they come tonight?

75
00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:55,179
Because of you, our plan is ruined.

76
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,165
Stop it.

77
00:05:56,165 --> 00:05:57,579
He said tomorrow. So be it.

78
00:05:57,782 --> 00:05:59,402
We just need to wait here.

79
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:01,801
Bro.

80
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:04,779
Why don’t we go stay in the abandoned factory?

81
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,134
That’s a good idea.

82
00:06:09,134 --> 00:06:10,530
We should sleep there tonight.

83
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,977
Until the new truck arrives,

84
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,857
Let’s move the artifacts inside.

85
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:15,583
Let’s move.

86
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:28,435
Hey, what the hell are you looking at?

87
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:29,979
Go help them move the artifacts.

88
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,490
Tor Thanaphob

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,650
Gun Atthaphan

90
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,170
Foei Patara

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,810
Namtan Tipnaree

Saiparn Apinya

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,970
Directed by Attaporn Theemakorn

95
00:07:33,727 --> 00:07:34,306
Hey.

96
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:41,979
Mr. Katha.

97
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:51,580
All the missing artifacts are from Zone 16.

98
00:07:52,628 --> 00:07:53,457
I checked.

99
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:56,379
No artifacts from other zones are stolen.

100
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:02,254
Did you contact your detective friend?

101
00:08:02,254 --> 00:08:03,582
Her name is Bam.

102
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,539
I contacted her.

103
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:09,935
She is working with local police to track any trucks

104
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,865
that are suspected to be used by the robbers.

105
00:08:11,865 --> 00:08:14,379
I think she will contact us soon.

106
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:25,808
What?

107
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,779
I have something to confess.

108
00:08:39,398 --> 00:08:41,050
I know one of the robbers.

109
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,905
He was my coworker at the café.

110
00:08:45,269 --> 00:08:49,179
I think he helped his friends to rob the museum.

111
00:08:50,914 --> 00:08:52,253
Moron.

112
00:08:53,171 --> 00:08:55,952
Your mistake this time is that

113
00:08:55,977 --> 00:08:58,803
you don’t keep the card that I’ve given you.

114
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,702
That’s why this incident happened.

115
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:04,162
Go away.

116
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,700
I don’t want to see you right now.

117
00:09:09,245 --> 00:09:10,779
Get out!

118
00:09:26,986 --> 00:09:29,025
If you’re going to easily tell him to go away,

119
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,379
why had you watched him for weeks?

120
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,205
It’s none of your business.

121
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,158
Did your detective friend contact you back?

122
00:09:37,158 --> 00:09:38,379
Her name is Bam.

123
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,979
I think we should go see her at the police sta…

124
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:45,577
…tion.

125
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:54,608
Don’t bury your head in the sand like an ostrich.

126
00:09:57,165 --> 00:10:00,085
The behavior of ostriches burying their head in the sand

127
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,579
is used as a metaphor for people who run away from problems.

128
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,979
Pretending like there is no problem.

129
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,979
All animals have survival instincts.

130
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:14,312
When they are in danger,

131
00:10:14,312 --> 00:10:17,979
their brain will tell them to flee and avoid confrontation.

132
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:27,410
But some animals can use their hidden skills to deal with the enemy.

133
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,779
Which one are you?

134
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:31,179
Are you those who run away from the problem?

135
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:33,579
Or are you those who confront the problem?

136
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:43,179
I think since I am the reason why the museum was robbed, I should leave.

137
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:45,579
Don’t you think that you need to take responsibility for it?

138
00:10:45,745 --> 00:10:47,278
I want to take responsibility.

139
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,179
But I don’t know what to do.

140
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,290
Have you ever sensed or heard something strange?

141
00:10:57,733 --> 00:10:59,979
Do you know that every object has frequencies?

142
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,040
But they are inaudible to human ears.

143
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:08,379
Only those with special skills can hear them.

144
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,352
When I first met you,

145
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:13,886
I knew that you were not an ordinary person.

146
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:15,850
What do you mean?

147
00:11:18,437 --> 00:11:20,380
Listen for the signal carefully.

148
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,407
Maybe you can find where the stolen artifacts are stored.

149
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,085
Here.

150
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:31,180
Triphob asked me to give it to you in case you need to come back here.

151
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,979
Dome.

152
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:40,779
When ostriches bury their head in the sand,

153
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,179
They aren’t running away from the problem.

154
00:11:44,828 --> 00:11:49,807
Actually, they are protecting a valuable thing hidden underneath.

155
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,179
The car is ready.

156
00:12:20,694 --> 00:12:22,779
Mr. Dome is leaving.

157
00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:25,179
Aren’t you going to go see him?

158
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:09,579
(Triphob asked me to give it to you in case you need to come back here.)

159
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:15,579
(Listen for the signal carefully.)

160
00:13:16,248 --> 00:13:19,179
(Maybe you can find where the stolen artifacts are stored.)

161
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,309
Why isn’t the new truck here yet?

162
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:22,108
It’s been a day.

163
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:26,382
If the truck is not here yet, why don’t we go out to find a new truck?

164
00:14:27,351 --> 00:14:28,640
Bro.

165
00:14:28,665 --> 00:14:31,179
We ran out of food.

166
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,179
Are they betraying us?

167
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,777
Shut up.

168
00:14:48,851 --> 00:14:50,379
Do you see this dagger?

169
00:14:50,948 --> 00:14:52,779
I’ve been looking for it all night.

170
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,580
It’s not with me.

171
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:09,579
If I took it, why would I ask you about it?

172
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:12,468
Someone needs to go look for it.

173
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,202
I’m not doing it.

174
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,103
I’m not going.

175
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,382
You two go look for it.

176
00:15:27,757 --> 00:15:28,779
I’m not going.

177
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,705
Go now.

178
00:15:32,274 --> 00:15:33,579
Go.

179
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:58,779
I knew you would come back.

180
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,179
You came back sooner than I thought.

181
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:03,579
What do I need to do to find the stolen artifacts?

182
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,602
Stay calm.

183
00:16:07,437 --> 00:16:09,007
Be focused.

184
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:13,179
Listen to the signal carefully.

185
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:21,577
You will gradually see the picture clearer.

186
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:23,109
Clearer.

187
00:16:24,223 --> 00:16:25,400
Clearer.

188
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:32,822
Don’t let my phone run out of battery.

189
00:16:32,822 --> 00:16:34,182
Damn it, bro.

190
00:16:34,182 --> 00:16:35,979
You’re only worried about your battery.

191
00:16:44,696 --> 00:16:46,053
I found it.

192
00:16:46,053 --> 00:16:47,980
Alright. Hurry up.

193
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,979
What happened?

194
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,736
I don’t know.

195
00:17:01,736 --> 00:17:03,930
I thought I cut my hand when I reached for the dagger.

196
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,822
But my hand is getting numb.

197
00:17:11,376 --> 00:17:12,161
Damn.

198
00:17:12,161 --> 00:17:13,376
We’re screwed.

199
00:17:13,376 --> 00:17:14,907
Let’s get out of here first.

200
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:17,635
Sit down.

201
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,115
Stay with me.

202
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,441
Don’t fall asleep.

203
00:17:24,441 --> 00:17:26,005
Hang in there.

204
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:26,924
Petch.

205
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,408
Petch.

206
00:17:35,377 --> 00:17:37,177
The damned snake.

207
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:41,414
The damned snake.

208
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:44,161
Did you bite my brother?

209
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:47,614
The damned snake.

210
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:50,382
Did you bite my brother?

211
00:18:00,921 --> 00:18:02,380
Petch.

212
00:18:04,275 --> 00:18:05,405
Petch.

213
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:08,379
Petch, where are you?

214
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:13,908
Petch, where are you?

215
00:18:43,977 --> 00:18:45,582
Did you find them?

216
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,979
I’ll go get everything back.

217
00:18:48,939 --> 00:18:50,958
When Mr. Katha and Mr. Triphob come back,

218
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,779
Please tell them that I’m taking responsibility for it.

219
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,179
Thank you.

220
00:19:22,297 --> 00:19:23,851
What did you do this time?

221
00:19:23,851 --> 00:19:26,380
How could no news about the robbery at the museum

222
00:19:26,405 --> 00:19:28,421
located in the center of the city be published?

223
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,979
You know the answer.

224
00:19:32,475 --> 00:19:33,579
I know.

225
00:19:34,805 --> 00:19:37,092
I’m just saying if you released the news to the press,

226
00:19:37,117 --> 00:19:38,922
you would find their traces faster.

227
00:19:39,771 --> 00:19:43,125
You said that the museum is open only to invited visitors.

228
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,379
How did it get robbed?

229
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:47,407
Did you invite the robbers to the museum?

230
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,696
It’s because of a new staff member.

231
00:19:49,696 --> 00:19:51,579
He started working at the museum recently.

232
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:55,179
He didn’t invite them to rob the museum.

233
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:02,379
About the news, Mr. Katha doesn’t want it to go public.

234
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:04,654
To tell you the truth,

235
00:20:04,654 --> 00:20:06,777
I don’t like him.

236
00:20:06,777 --> 00:20:08,008
He’s pretentious.

237
00:20:08,008 --> 00:20:10,779
He always tells you to fix all kinds of problems.

238
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,443
Why don’t you go help your dad manage his company

239
00:20:14,468 --> 00:20:16,803
instead of working for him?

240
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,114
I’m just like you.

241
00:20:19,114 --> 00:20:20,946
You didn’t listen to your mom and became a police officer.

242
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:23,979
You are good at retorting.

243
00:20:38,881 --> 00:20:40,112
Thank you.

244
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,979
For always helping me.

245
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:53,441
This must be serious.

246
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:55,179
He has been staring at the screens since the afternoon.

247
00:20:57,234 --> 00:21:01,179
Among the stolen artifacts, there are important items.

248
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,579
That’s why he came here.

249
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:06,502
Wait.

250
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,694
Can I see the video from this camera?

251
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,100
Yes.

252
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:21,577
That is a road for heading out of the city.

253
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,306
Can you pause the video?

254
00:21:32,697 --> 00:21:34,165
Can you zoom in?

255
00:21:34,165 --> 00:21:35,494
Yes.

256
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:43,297
Can you make it clearer?

257
00:21:43,297 --> 00:21:44,382
Yes.

258
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:51,579
That’s Mr. Dome, isn’t it?

259
00:21:55,665 --> 00:21:57,579
Triphob, go get the car.

260
00:22:08,934 --> 00:22:10,256
Why did they take so long?

261
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:12,663
If you are worried about them, why don’t you call them?

262
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:33,577
Petch.

263
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:35,503
Why did you take so long?

264
00:22:40,382 --> 00:22:41,727
Did you find the dagger?

265
00:22:41,727 --> 00:22:42,767
Petch.

266
00:22:45,582 --> 00:22:46,779
Damn.

267
00:22:58,023 --> 00:22:59,351
Petch.

268
00:22:59,637 --> 00:23:01,177
Don’t come closer.

269
00:23:01,856 --> 00:23:03,026
Don’t.

270
00:23:12,259 --> 00:23:13,180
Petch.

271
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,891
Don’t.

272
00:23:17,891 --> 00:23:18,905
Petch, don’t.

273
00:23:18,905 --> 00:23:20,382
Petch.

274
00:23:31,057 --> 00:23:32,380
Is he dead?

275
00:23:43,139 --> 00:23:44,379
M		It.

276
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:46,491
It.

277
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,580
It.

278
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,419
Don’t come closer.

279
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:57,014
If you come closer, I’ll stab you.

280
00:23:57,914 --> 00:23:58,779
It.

281
00:25:06,666 --> 00:25:07,939
Damn.

282
00:25:09,463 --> 00:25:11,977
It, stay away from me.

283
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,084
If you come closer, I’ll stab you. I’m serious.

284
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:14,825
It.

285
00:25:15,728 --> 00:25:16,820
Don’t come any closer.

286
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,767
I’m serious.

287
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:18,853
It.

288
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,579
I told you to stay away from me.

289
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:38,834
Damn.

290
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:41,977
Boss.

291
00:25:42,131 --> 00:25:43,373
What the hell is wrong with you?

292
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,980
Boss.

293
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:51,997
Boss.

294
00:25:54,562 --> 00:25:55,637
Boss.

295
00:27:45,662 --> 00:27:46,632
Jib.

296
00:27:49,352 --> 00:27:50,376
Jib.

297
00:27:50,376 --> 00:27:51,397
Jib, wake up.

298
00:27:51,397 --> 00:27:52,562
Dome.

299
00:27:53,884 --> 00:27:55,042
Get up slowly.

300
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:03,579
How did you get here?

301
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:09,004
Dome, we need to get out of here.

302
00:28:09,577 --> 00:28:10,728
Hurry.

303
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,379
Hurry, Dome.

304
00:28:25,854 --> 00:28:27,120
Run, Dome.

305
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:28,330
Hurry.

306
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,413
Hurry.

307
00:28:50,915 --> 00:28:52,305
Ouch.

308
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,088
Run. Now.

309
00:28:58,063 --> 00:28:59,422
Hurry.

310
00:28:59,552 --> 00:29:00,752
Jib.

311
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,207
Dome is not answering his phone.

312
00:29:38,146 --> 00:29:39,579
Are you worried about him?

313
00:29:40,875 --> 00:29:42,703
No. I’m worried about the artifacts.

314
00:29:42,703 --> 00:29:43,877
Is that so?

315
00:29:43,877 --> 00:29:45,819
I just want to warn you.

316
00:29:45,844 --> 00:29:49,151
If Dome is in danger,

317
00:29:49,176 --> 00:29:54,284
I hope you won’t risk your life for him who you’ve known only shortly.

318
00:29:54,284 --> 00:29:56,379
Just do your job.

319
00:29:57,472 --> 00:29:58,379
Yes.

320
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:00,505
I got it.

321
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:10,777
Did you get anything?

322
00:30:11,354 --> 00:30:14,789
They were heading to Pathum Thani before going to another province.

323
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:17,088
I have my subordinate contact the local police.

324
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,379
The search area is within a 5-km radius from here.

325
00:30:22,561 --> 00:30:23,979
Then what are we waiting for?

326
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:26,038
We are waiting for a reinforcement unit.

327
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:27,865
The 5-km radius is not a small area.

328
00:30:27,865 --> 00:30:29,179
How long do we have to wait?

329
00:30:29,204 --> 00:30:31,084
Around three hours for the reinforcement unit to get here.

330
00:30:38,284 --> 00:30:39,617
I’m not waiting.

331
00:30:39,617 --> 00:30:40,779
Give me the car key.

332
00:30:40,997 --> 00:30:43,179
You stay here with your friend.

333
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:44,379
Her name is Bam.

334
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:45,576
Give me the car key.

335
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,779
Are you alright?

336
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:20,377
Come here.

337
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,974
Quiet.

338
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:26,146
Easy.

339
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:29,485
Jib.

340
00:31:29,672 --> 00:31:30,792
Are you okay?

341
00:31:30,792 --> 00:31:31,561
Let me take a look.

342
00:31:31,561 --> 00:31:32,739
No.

343
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:33,491
Let me take a look.

344
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,806
I said no.

345
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:40,779
Don’t pretend to be a good person, Dome.

346
00:31:41,008 --> 00:31:42,508
I don’t trust you.

347
00:31:45,057 --> 00:31:46,780
What did I do that upset you?

348
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:51,577
You’ve changed.

349
00:31:53,423 --> 00:31:55,804
What do you mean? I don’t get it.

350
00:32:00,441 --> 00:32:02,379
You are the only one

351
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,977
who said I should do everything for my survival.

352
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:07,802
Me?

353
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,450
Yes.

354
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:13,179
But why have you changed?

355
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:16,779
Why are you looking at me like that?

356
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:22,205
That I’m a bad guy and you are a good guy.

357
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:25,179
Ouch!

358
00:32:26,503 --> 00:32:27,897
Jib, are you alright?

359
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,650
- Jib. - Damn it.

360
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,779
Dome.

361
00:32:35,241 --> 00:32:36,560
What’s wrong with me?

362
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:39,555
Am I becoming like them?

363
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,705
Dome.

364
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:42,167
I don’t want to become a monster.

365
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,768
Dome, please help me.

366
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:45,718
Jib.

367
00:32:45,718 --> 00:32:47,434
Dome, please help me.

368
00:32:47,651 --> 00:32:49,562
- Jib. - Don’t let me become a monster like them.

369
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:53,871
I found you.

370
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:54,500
Get up.

371
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,228
Now.

372
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:01,152
Dome, help me.

373
00:33:04,986 --> 00:33:07,180
You can’t run away from me.

374
00:33:07,856 --> 00:33:09,580
Dome, help me.

375
00:33:13,807 --> 00:33:15,410
What are you doing?

376
00:33:16,379 --> 00:33:17,423
Dome, what are you doing?

377
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:18,762
Shut up.

378
00:33:20,188 --> 00:33:21,579
Dome, hurry up.

379
00:33:23,111 --> 00:33:23,980
Dome.

380
00:33:24,748 --> 00:33:26,380
He’s coming. Hurry up.

381
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:30,321
Dome, hurry up.

382
00:33:42,595 --> 00:33:44,379
I’m sorry, Dome.

383
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,579
(All animals have survival instincts.)

384
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:53,974
(When they are in danger.)

385
00:33:53,974 --> 00:33:57,577
(Their brain will tell them to flee and avoid confrontation.)

386
00:34:06,164 --> 00:34:13,179
(But some animals can use their hidden skills to deal with the enemy.)

387
00:35:11,037 --> 00:35:11,977
You!

388
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,352
Be quiet.

389
00:37:18,377 --> 00:37:19,527
It’s me.

390
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:25,805
What are you doing here?

391
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,672
I just want to take responsibility for my mistake.

392
00:37:28,672 --> 00:37:29,980
Moron.

393
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:31,805
It’s not your fault.

394
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,980
That’s right.

395
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,177
It’s not your fault.

396
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,579
I…

397
00:37:41,391 --> 00:37:42,608
I’m sorry.

398
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,063
What are they?

399
00:37:55,272 --> 00:37:56,379
Poisonous animals.

400
00:37:59,582 --> 00:38:02,655
In the museum, there’s a dagger that underwent a curse ritual

401
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,779
that let poisonous animals kill one another.

402
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:08,379
That dagger was cursed.

403
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:10,331
Anyone who touches it.

404
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,690
They will be killed by the poison

405
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:17,600
or transform into poisonous monsters.

406
00:38:18,783 --> 00:38:21,579
They will kill one another to survive.

407
00:38:27,158 --> 00:38:28,779
Don’t show that look.

408
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:32,379
If you feel sympathy for them, you will become their target.

409
00:38:33,296 --> 00:38:34,386
You may not believe me.

410
00:38:34,386 --> 00:38:35,980
But that’s how the world is.

411
00:38:37,084 --> 00:38:38,380
Just focus on your survival.

412
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:41,602
What are you doing here?

413
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:43,146
Are you stupid?

414
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:44,189
I’m here to help you.

415
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,582
That’s what I’m saying. Why are you here to help me?

416
00:38:45,582 --> 00:38:47,407
I…

417
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,379
We need to get out of here.

418
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,977
Run.

419
00:39:06,657 --> 00:39:07,179
No.

420
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,379
I’m not leaving you.

421
00:39:08,985 --> 00:39:10,779
Don’t worry about me.

422
00:39:11,665 --> 00:39:12,611
Go.

423
00:40:43,767 --> 00:40:45,103
I told you.

424
00:40:45,103 --> 00:40:46,779
You can’t run away from me.

425
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:53,143
Today, I will survive.

426
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:12,838
Are you okay?

427
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,383
I’m okay.

428
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:28,085
You.

429
00:41:58,145 --> 00:41:59,423
Run away.

430
00:42:00,005 --> 00:42:02,379
No, I’m staying with you.

431
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:10,780
Stop it.

432
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,380
Go away.

433
00:42:27,684 --> 00:42:28,782
Go away.

434
00:43:02,568 --> 00:43:03,577
Mr. Katha.

435
00:43:05,602 --> 00:43:06,699
Chan.

436
00:43:10,346 --> 00:43:11,980
I…

437
00:43:14,477 --> 00:43:15,580
Mr. Katha.

438
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:19,754
Mr. Katha.

439
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:21,579
Wake up.

440
00:43:22,054 --> 00:43:23,404
Wake up.

441
00:43:23,404 --> 00:43:24,986
Mr. Katha, wake up.

442
00:43:24,986 --> 00:43:26,377
Wake up.

443
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:29,951
Mr. Katha.

444
00:43:29,951 --> 00:43:30,749
Help him.

445
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,749
- Wake up. - We need to hurry and take him back to the museum

446
00:43:32,774 --> 00:43:33,610
Wake up.

447
00:43:36,688 --> 00:43:37,831
Listen to me.

448
00:43:37,831 --> 00:43:39,577
Take him back to the museum.

449
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:41,315
Right now.

450
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:42,594
Go.

451
00:43:55,977 --> 00:43:57,580
What happened?

452
00:44:02,235 --> 00:44:03,577
Mr. Katha.

453
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,376
Wake up.

454
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:07,179
Wake up.

455
00:44:19,204 --> 00:44:21,579
Wake up.

[Midnight Museum - The Poisonous-Animal Dagger]

462
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,225
While I and my team were investigating the crime scene,

463
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:12,160
It seemed like all of us couldn’t remember anything for two hours.

464
00:46:12,327 --> 00:46:13,468
I want to prove it.

465
00:46:14,081 --> 00:46:15,580
Can you get me the butterfly?

466
00:46:15,631 --> 00:46:17,146
What is the butterfly?

467
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:18,751
Memory Butterfly.

468
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:27,337
Zen.

469
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:29,980
What’s wrong, Rin?

470
00:46:30,882 --> 00:46:32,379
I will never leave you to be alone, Rin.
