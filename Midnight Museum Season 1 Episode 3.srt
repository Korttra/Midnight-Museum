1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,210
Does anyone see this dagger?

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:02,050
Found it.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:09,580
Wake up.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:15,130
Someone once told me...

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,020
The second you're going to die,

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,800
the memory you've made through life

7
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,960
flashes right before your eyes.

8
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,820
Help!

9
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,570
Can I call you Khatha?

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,180
The memory of my long, lengthy life...

11
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:43,120
Wait outside, Phob.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,270
Grandpa has something to talk with Mr. Katha.

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,580
Where is the wound this time, sir?

14
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,160
It seems you're in quite some pain.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,549
I am.

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,450
You know very well how deadly the poison is.

17
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:13,340
As someone who have died before,

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,040
do you have any advice for me?

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,513
I didn't know you're afraid of death.

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,670
You're about the only one who isn't.

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,580
I'm not trying to scare you, Annop,

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,660
but death

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,240
is simply painful

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,870
and excruciatingly torturing.

25
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,380
So you do know.

26
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,510
Then why won't you stop?

27
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,120
Will you promise me?

28
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,764
Promise me you won't give up your life for someone so easily again.

29
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,280
Of course.

30
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,162
I promise.

31
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,350
If I am to die,

32
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,680
I will do it when it really matters.

33
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,680
That means...

34
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,400
This really matters to you.

35
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,227
But it's time for you to wake up.

36
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,937
I know you're here to remind me of the promise

37
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:02,464
I gave to your grandfather.

38
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,402
I didn't break it, by the way.

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,230
It really was kind of important this time.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,742
Your grandfather won't be mad at me.

41
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,490
You saw Grandpa?

42
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,065
Don't be ridiculous.

43
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,735
Your grandfather is no longer here.

44
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,264
What I saw

45
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,600
was just a flash of my own memory.

46
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:28,050
You don't believe me, Triphob?

47
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,820
Whether I do or not

48
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,140
does not matter.

49
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,510
Right now you believe that Mr. Dome

50
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,030
is the person you've been looking for.

51
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,302
Mr. Khatha.

52
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,380
Did you forget what you told me?

53
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,320
You said the cycle of death and rebirth isn't real.

54
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,971
I did not forget.

55
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,432
But Dome...

56
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,924
Dome is very similar to that person.

57
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,557
Too similar.

58
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,724
Triphob.

59
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,350
I want to prove this.

60
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,920
Get me the moths.

61
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,550
Then I'd better contact Bam.

62
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:33,535
Phob.

63
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,220
All the stolen artifacts from the museum

64
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,167
are gone.

65
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,010
Disappear.

66
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,590
Directed by Attaporn Theemakorn

67
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,735
I can tell from the face you're making...

68
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,610
You're curious about Khatha, aren't you?

69
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,660
He came back to life right after he died.

70
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,650
That isn't normal, is it?

71
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,790
Ever since you got here,

72
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,935
is there anything that counts as "normal," Dome?

73
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,795
It's a curse.

74
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,358
A curse?

75
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,890
How is immortality a curse?

76
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,890
You must stay alive for all eternity.

77
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,377
No matter how much pain you're in,

78
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:51,535
you can never be free of your suffering.

79
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,630
You keep perpetually coming back to life

80
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:56,190
until someone comes along and release—

81
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,420
I need to talk to you.

82
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,710
How did you do that?

83
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,930
How did I do what?

84
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,370
Summoning the spirit from the dagger.

85
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,646
And what you did with her, too.

86
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,248
Tell me.

87
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,318
Who exactly are you?

88
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:36,880
I don't know.

89
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,982
How could you not?

90
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,760
Tell me right now.

91
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,760
Let's all stay calm.

92
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,896
Don't butt in.

93
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,890
Mr. Khatha.

94
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,722
We're in trouble.

95
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,110
So this is the museum?

96
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,420
I'll ask you again, Shorty...

97
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:06,980
Her name is Bam.

98
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,740
What did you mean when you said all the artifacts are gone?

99
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,870
I told you. My men and I were investigating the crime scene.

100
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,901
But we suddenly felt a strange sensation.

101
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,320
Next thing we knew, all the artifacts were gone.

102
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,900
When we talked,

103
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,770
we all agreed that there was a two-hour gap in all of our memories.

104
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,769
I guess we really need to find the moths as soon as possible.

105
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,953
What are these moths you're talking about?

106
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,984
The Moths of Memory.

107
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,700
One of the haunted artifacts in Zone 16.

108
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:48,140
The Moths of Memory?

109
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,400
The moths feed off the blood of living things.

110
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,600
Once they drink the blood,

111
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,290
they will also gain the memory of the host.

112
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,620
What do we need them for?

113
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,470
Well...

114
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,830
When you eat the moth,

115
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,020
you can see the memory of the person whose blood it feeds off.

116
00:11:20,945 --> 00:11:23,780
But I think the moths would have probably been taken from the scene.

117
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,880
These moths are unlike any other artifacts.

118
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,950
They have a life and a mind of their own.

119
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,390
They will always find a way to survive.

120
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,920
My guess is they're trying to reproduce right now.

121
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,110
I might be able to help.

122
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,132
No.

123
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,560
You stay out of this.

124
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:48,520
But it was Dome who found the robbers.

125
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,329
And what happened after that?

126
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,680
You saw what you did.

127
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,410
Wasn't it you who told me

128
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,590
to take responsibility?

129
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,631
Sorry I'm late.

130
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:21,159
Happy Anniversary.

131
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,100
Thanks.

132
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,399
Let's get going.

133
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,718
Same hiding place, huh.

134
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,270
It's in the drawer, right?

135
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:01,892
I'll grab it.

136
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,316
Zen.

137
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,760
What is it, Rin?

138
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,440
Who the hell did this?

139
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,350
Hey.

140
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,290
Who's there?

141
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,100
Zen, wait.

142
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,180
Zen, don't.

143
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:44,390
Hey!

144
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,200
Where've they gone?

145
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,640
Shit!

146
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,380
I used to think that

147
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,570
Your being a...

148
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,210
homebody

149
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,050
who doesn't like going out

150
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,890
or looking at other girls

151
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,080
was enough for me.

152
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,210
You're not gonna press charges?

153
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,697
Do you see all this evidence, officer?

154
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,500
Huh?

155
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:34,582
What if he comes back to hurt her?

156
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,317
Please stay calm.

157
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,590
There's nothing we can do right now

158
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,290
because nothing serious has happened yet.

159
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:43,400
Does someone have to freaking die first for you people to do your job?

160
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,895
What about you?

161
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,680
Do you have someone in mind?

162
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,390
There was no evidence of force entry.

163
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,660
Maybe the suspect is someone you know.

164
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,920
How could my girlfriend know the psychopath who broke into her house?

165
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:06,330
Huh?

166
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,266
I don't care what it is,

167
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,150
you need to do something.

168
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,260
If anything happens to my girlfriend,

169
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,150
I'm going to make sure your entire precinct gets suspended.

170
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:14,630
Sir,

171
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,710
you're threatening a police officer.

172
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,870
I'm not threatening you.

173
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:19,820
I'm warning you.

174
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,805
Hey.

175
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,130
Pay attention, will you?

176
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,090
I am paying attention.

177
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,870
What more evidence do you need?

178
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,980
Dome's taking way too long.

179
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,760
Told you not to come.

180
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,250
If you can't wait, just...

181
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,097
teleport yourself back to the museum.

182
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,500
Like I could do that.

183
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,110
I'm not a ghost, I'll have you know.

184
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,850
When you were in Zone 16,

185
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,564
what were you talking to Dome about?

186
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:10,410
Dome asked how you came back to life.

187
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,220
What did you tell him?

188
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,120
I told him that

189
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,600
immortals are cursed individuals

190
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,990
waiting for someone to release them.

191
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:28,230
Do you think that someone is Dome?

192
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:35,200
I don't know how you got that curse,

193
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:39,220
but I don't think anyone can break it for you.

194
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:44,460
It's you who needs to do it yourself.

195
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,090
Aren't you well-versed with this kind of stuff?

196
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,160
Of course I am.

197
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,800
I'm just like you.

198
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,890
You helped me once.

199
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,030
I'll help you, too.

200
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,285
So?

201
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,580
I talked to Uncle Lek.

202
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,990
But I got nothing.

203
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,540
He doesn't even know Jib's full name or address.

204
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,620
So we're at a deadend.

205
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,540
There's nothing else to go on.

206
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Dome.

207
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,109
No.

208
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,210
We're not doing that.

209
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,170
Do you have a better idea?

210
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:36,380
Dome.

211
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:38,380
Hey, I said no.

212
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,435
Dome.

213
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,568
Stop it.

214
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,969
Dome, stop.

215
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,906
Dome?

216
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,355
Dome. Dome.

217
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,285
Take it easy.

218
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,370
Take a deep breath, Dome.

219
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,225
Dome.

220
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,460
Dome, take a breath.

221
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,266
- Dome. - Dome.

222
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,983
Dome.

223
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,084
Dome.

224
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:05,260
Are you sure you don't want me to stay with you?

225
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,276
Yeah.

226
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,580
Fine.

227
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,840
Can I talk to you?

228
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,489
Come on in.

229
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,739
What's wrong?

230
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,747
Nothing.

231
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,220
What the cop said was true, wasn't it?

232
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,220
Are you keeping something from me?

233
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,480
No. I told you everything—

234
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,080
Don't lie.

235
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:12,810
What's with you?

236
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,552
You know I don't like liars.

237
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,677
The guy in the photo in your drawer...

238
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,450
You know him, don't you?

239
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,435
Huh?

240
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,800
Why didn't you say anything when that cop asked you?

241
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,345
- You're hurting me. - Am I?

242
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,800
Not more than you're hurting me!

243
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,490
Do you keep his photo

244
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,490
because you still love him?

245
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,725
Answer me.

246
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,110
Are you still in love with him?

247
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:40,225
Don't.

248
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:41,840
Don't do this.

249
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,672
What?

250
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:44,945
Don't worry.

251
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:47,010
You belong to me and me only.

252
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:01,200
He did that to you?

253
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,805
(I'm outside. Come out and talk.)

254
00:33:09,885 --> 00:33:10,975
Where are you?

255
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,595
I'm right outside your house.

256
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,869
Rin.

257
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,400
Why won't you say something?

258
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:17,816
Hello?

259
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,863
Rin?

260
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,195
Hello?

261
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,070
Hello, Rin?

262
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,281
Rin.

263
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,710
There you are.

264
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,765
Fine.

265
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,890
I'll get you, bastard.

266
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,790
Damn it!

267
00:34:29,255 --> 00:34:30,684
Hey.

268
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,840
Stop.

269
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:45,170
Found you, asshole.

270
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:53,170
Where the hell are you?

271
00:34:53,195 --> 00:34:54,557
Come out.

272
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,010
I'm here.

273
00:35:01,175 --> 00:35:02,776
I'll kill you.

274
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,275
That was for what you did to Rin.

275
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,940
What happened?

276
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:54,815
Don't ever do what you did yesterday again.

277
00:35:58,315 --> 00:35:59,870
Ever heard of getting a curse rebound?

278
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,310
Making frequent connection with cursed objects

279
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:11,060
will force your body to be a channel for all this negative energy.

280
00:36:11,935 --> 00:36:14,715
You'll eventually become cursed yourself.

281
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:19,928
Do you want to be a piece in my collection or something?

282
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:24,185
Why do you collect them anyway?

283
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,805
Because it is my responsibility.

284
00:36:29,255 --> 00:36:30,275
Your responsibility?

285
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,910
Why is it your responsibility?

286
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,120
Did you do something wrong?

287
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,779
Don't cross the line.

288
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,770
Just know what I let you know.

289
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:57,365
Keep what I told you in mind.

290
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,740
Don't ever do what you did again.

291
00:37:17,350 --> 00:37:18,779
How are you feeling?

292
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,183
I'm okay now.

293
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:27,160
The face you're making...

294
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,855
Did he give you another lecture?

295
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:35,205
He's not actually a bad person, you know.

296
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,500
When you were out cold,

297
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:41,020
he didn't once leave your side since yesterday's evening.

298
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,960
Since yesterday's evening?

299
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,465
He stayed with me?

300
00:37:46,895 --> 00:37:47,934
Yes.

301
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,390
He said you're one of his people now.

302
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,675
So he had to take care of you.

303
00:38:02,115 --> 00:38:03,333
What are you doing?

304
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:04,980
I'll try again.

305
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,375
Do you want another lecture?

306
00:38:08,005 --> 00:38:09,083
No.

307
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,530
I'm one of you guys now.

308
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,985
I have to take responsibility.

309
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,520
You do know this is dangerous, right?

310
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,604
If it comes to that,

311
00:38:18,845 --> 00:38:20,350
I'll be in your care, June.

312
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:53,275
Sir, you're threatening a police officer.

313
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,475
I'm not threatening you.

314
00:38:54,845 --> 00:38:56,157
I'm warning you.

315
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,323
I found it.

316
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,127
Mr. Khatha.

317
00:39:09,475 --> 00:39:10,935
Mr. Khatha, open the door.

318
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,155
Mr. Khatha, open the—

319
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,567
What?

320
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,028
We need to contact Mr. Triphob right away.

321
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,770
Rinlada Pitkosol.

322
00:39:29,565 --> 00:39:31,555
The address is 21/85.

323
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,775
She came in to report a break-in.

324
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,440
But does this have anything to do with the moths we're looking for?

325
00:39:38,965 --> 00:39:40,113
Yes, it does.

326
00:40:26,955 --> 00:40:28,376
What?

327
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,686
I...

328
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,577
I got you this.

329
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:38,141
For me?

330
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:39,864
Yeah.

331
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,685
You don't like it?

332
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,067
What's the occasion?

333
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,799
Well...

334
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:49,735
It's our first anniversary.

335
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,625
Turn around.

336
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:57,937
I'll put it on for you.

337
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,997
Hurry up.

338
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,601
Wait, wait.

339
00:41:02,655 --> 00:41:03,836
Let me get my hair.

340
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,570
I got it. Hold on.

341
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,211
There.

342
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,356
Come here.

343
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,622
Come here.

344
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:27,030
What's with you?

345
00:41:28,135 --> 00:41:29,405
What?

346
00:41:29,605 --> 00:41:31,030
I don't know.

347
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:34,750
It just feels kinda strange that you'd do something like this, Moth.

348
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,870
It's our anniversary so I thought I'd do something new for a change.

349
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,558
Well...

350
00:41:44,195 --> 00:41:46,350
"Something new" would be us going out.

351
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,115
You know I don't like going outside.

352
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:54,110
You never go anywhere with me.

353
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,110
I used to think that

354
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,315
Your being a...

355
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,035
homebody

356
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:16,805
who doesn't like going out

357
00:42:17,355 --> 00:42:18,650
or looking at other girls

358
00:42:21,035 --> 00:42:22,440
was enough for me.

359
00:42:27,765 --> 00:42:30,440
But now, even with you by my side, I just feel very lonely.

360
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:37,370
I feel like you don't really care about me.

361
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,065
Do you love me, Moth?

362
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,043
Of course, I do.

363
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:56,705
I love you all the time.

364
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:03,445
Do you love me, Rin?

365
00:43:30,305 --> 00:43:31,687
Rin.

366
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,586
Rin.

367
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:36,614
Do you love me, Rin?

368
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,545
You do, right?

369
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,927
Rin.

370
00:43:41,755 --> 00:43:42,826
Rin.

371
00:43:42,925 --> 00:43:44,115
Rin!

372
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,521
Rin!

373
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:47,613
Answer me!

374
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,509
Let's hang out today.

375
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,575
I told you to wait for a warrant.

376
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,295
The police sure work slow.

377
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:26,410
What are you, a bulldozer?

378
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:28,019
You didn't have to break the door down.

379
00:45:29,295 --> 00:45:30,826
Please, be quiet.

380
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:41,951
Upstairs.

381
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,885
You and Shorty take a look on the first floor.

382
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:53,040
I'll go upstairs.

383
00:45:53,065 --> 00:45:54,598
Her name is Bam.

384
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,635
Don't use it unless you really have to.

385
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,732
It's this room.

386
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,380
Get in there.

387
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:06,307
I'll deal with this.

388
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,140
Is she still breathing?

389
00:47:34,985 --> 00:47:35,405
Dome!

390
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:43,930
Dome.

391
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:45,680
Dome.

392
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:50,795
Dome.

393
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:53,112
Are you alright?

394
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:53,885
Dome?

395
00:47:54,865 --> 00:47:55,260
Dome.

396
00:47:56,255 --> 00:47:57,465
Are you alright?

397
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:57,990
Dome.

398
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:01,875
My body feels weird.

399
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,055
What the moths make you see

400
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:18,020
is long gone.

401
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:21,340
What would you understand?

402
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,405
You came back to me.

403
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,070
You're not going to leave me anymore—

404
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,235
Dome.

405
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,050
What happened?

406
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,424
I don't know.

407
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,645
You're hurting me.

408
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,130
Rin.

409
00:49:58,155 --> 00:49:59,245
Let go of me.

410
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,757
Rin.

411
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:01,745
Rin.

412
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,095
Rin, stop.

413
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,150
You're hurting me.

414
00:50:16,465 --> 00:50:17,996
It's you...

415
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:19,685
who needs to let me go.

416
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,205
Rin.

417
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:30,995
Rin.

418
00:51:31,470 --> 00:51:31,930
Rin.

419
00:51:32,225 --> 00:51:33,300
Rin.

420
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,655
Rin.

421
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:35,860
Rin.

422
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:37,045
Rin.

423
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:40,565
I'm sorry.

424
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:42,835
I'm sorry.

425
00:51:44,965 --> 00:51:45,580
I'm sorry.

426
00:51:53,245 --> 00:51:54,885
I'm sorry I left you alone.

427
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:00,265
I'm sorry you had to meet an asshole like him.

428
00:52:03,925 --> 00:52:05,995
I'm sorry I put you through this.

429
00:52:07,145 --> 00:52:08,050
I'm sorry.

430
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:11,645
I'm sorry, Rin.

431
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:14,125
I'm sorry.

432
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:16,205
I'm sorry.

433
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,640
You don't need to forgive me.

434
00:52:20,645 --> 00:52:21,990
You really don't.

435
00:52:25,055 --> 00:52:26,575
I won't leave you alone again.

436
00:52:30,015 --> 00:52:31,335
You won't have to be alone again.

437
00:52:32,575 --> 00:52:33,330
I'm sorry.

438
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:24,872
This is the Moth of Memory

439
00:53:24,897 --> 00:53:26,927
I managed to capture before they were all gone.

440
00:53:36,145 --> 00:53:37,475
Are you going to take forever?

441
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,684
Hurry up and eat it. We need to know what happend.

442
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,205
I know, alright?

443
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,300
Just give me a sec to mentally prepare myself.

444
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,927
This won't give me food poisoning, right?

445
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:35,200
I remember now.

446
00:54:36,235 --> 00:54:37,461
What happened?

447
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:06,378
What are you doing?

448
00:55:09,475 --> 00:55:12,545
Did you know that moth is a representation for a lot of things?

449
00:55:14,215 --> 00:55:15,720
Maidens,

450
00:55:16,785 --> 00:55:17,400
love,

451
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:19,065
souls,

452
00:55:19,965 --> 00:55:20,895
changes,

453
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,380
and rebirths.

454
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,905
Even immortality.

455
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,660
As long as its body remains,

456
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,465
it will never die.

457
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:55,175
Dome.

458
00:56:57,575 --> 00:57:00,510
You... have no memory.

459
00:57:02,915 --> 00:57:03,960
Who are you?

Midnight Museum - Moths of Memory

465
00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:42,330
Here's the autopsy report.

466
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,035
How many suspects were there exactly in this case?

467
00:57:46,995 --> 00:57:48,695
The report said there were five.

468
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,060
But only four bodies were sent here.

469
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:54,373
Did you send the other one somewhere else?

470
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,055
I have what you want.

471
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:33,400
But I want to double the amount we agreed.

472
00:58:34,985 --> 00:58:36,555
It has to be this price.

473
00:58:38,655 --> 00:58:40,076
If you won't take it,

474
00:58:40,925 --> 00:58:42,959
I'll sell it to someone else.

475
00:59:49,410 --> 00:59:50,210
I feel like

476
00:59:50,975 --> 00:59:53,120
I don't have any memories of my life before this.

477
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,060
(Rental Contract)

478
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,880
Think carefully.

479
01:00:00,155 --> 01:00:00,930
What is this?

480
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,660
This is the footage from the security camera,

481
01:00:04,025 --> 01:00:05,660
videos from his social media,

482
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:09,300
and on the deceased's camera roll we managed to get our hands on.

483
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:11,736
Anything you'd like to say for yourself?
