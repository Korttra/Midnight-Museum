00:00:00,701 --> 00:00:02,381
The Moths of Memory?

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,307
What do we need them for?

3
00:00:04,576 --> 00:00:05,562
Well...

4
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:07,476
When you eat the moth,

5
00:00:07,476 --> 00:00:10,819
you can see the memory of the person whose blood it feeds off.

6
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:12,692
You... have no memory.

7
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,378
Who are you?

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,010
(NOVEMBER 2022)

9
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,767
(THREE MONTHS BEFORE DOME STARTED WORKING AT THE MUSEUM.)

10
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:28,781
What are you going to do about the job at the café?

11
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:33,580
You're working there for less than a month.

12
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:35,308
Can't you continue to work with me?

13
00:00:36,114 --> 00:00:37,361
I know.

14
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:39,055
I'm thinking about it.

15
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,141
The job is so not me.

16
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:44,385
Servicing others is so annoying.

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,978
It's not easy to get a job these days, Jib.

18
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,291
You are an adult now.

19
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,475
Rascal.

20
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,619
This is not something you should be criticizing me for.

21
00:00:53,619 --> 00:00:57,580
I called to wish you a happy birthday, not to hear your lecture.

22
00:00:58,138 --> 00:00:59,978
I'm saying this because I have good intentions.

23
00:01:02,236 --> 00:01:03,621
Yeah.

24
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:04,778
Thanks anyway.

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,178
Now.

26
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,578
Listen to me.

27
00:01:10,623 --> 00:01:14,818
(Happy birthday to you)

28
00:01:15,871 --> 00:01:20,001
(Happy birthday to you)

29
00:01:20,576 --> 00:01:25,219
(Happy birthday, happy birthday)

30
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:31,177
(Happy birthday to you)

31
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:37,219
Happy 23rd birthday.

32
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:41,308
Why aren't saying anything?

33
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,018
This is awkward. Say something.

34
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,018
Are you listening to me, Dome?

35
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,421
Dome.

36
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:53,316
Dome.

45
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:17,980
Who are you?

46
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,236
Where are you going?

47
00:05:29,713 --> 00:05:31,181
I'm going back to my apartment.

48
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:33,038
Do you want me to do something?

49
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,681
I'm going with you.

50
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,177
You are living in this place?

51
00:05:55,812 --> 00:05:56,911
Yes.

52
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,380
This is my room.

53
00:06:50,682 --> 00:06:51,975
Do you want some water?

54
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:53,207
No, I'm fine.

55
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,808
Sure.

56
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:23,719
Hey.

57
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,181
Don't pull anything off.

58
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,252
The apartment's owner is living next door.

59
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,778
She's wanting to kick me out.

60
00:07:30,941 --> 00:07:32,146
Here's your water.

61
00:07:32,507 --> 00:07:33,577
Thank you.

62
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,501
Pack your bag.

63
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:37,634
Pack my bag?

64
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,578
Am I going somewhere?

65
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:41,978
You're moving to live at the museum.

66
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:42,904
Huh?!

67
00:07:44,135 --> 00:07:45,578
Aren't you going to take responsibility?

68
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:47,657
I'm taking responsibility.

69
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:48,508
I'm not running away.

70
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:50,378
How can I trust you?

71
00:07:50,558 --> 00:07:52,778
I need to keep you in my sight at all times.

72
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:53,978
One more thing.

73
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:57,106
If something unexpected happens,

74
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:04,211
I want you to stay close to me as much as possible.

75
00:08:09,136 --> 00:08:10,170
Dome.

76
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,378
What you are doing is more dangerous than you thought.

77
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:16,780
You need to stay close to me.

78
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,178
If something happens,

79
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:22,778
I will be able to stop it in time.

80
00:08:30,063 --> 00:08:31,178
I got it.

81
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,936
That's Jib.

82
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:58,546
He was one of the thieves.

83
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:00,605
He was the one who hit me in the head.

84
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:04,780
Were you two close?

85
00:09:05,719 --> 00:09:07,175
I...

86
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,603
I think so.

87
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:15,578
I don't remember much.

88
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:18,599
What do you mean?

89
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:27,578
I can't remember anything about my past.

90
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,906
I try to remember it.

91
00:09:29,906 --> 00:09:31,178
But I can't remember anything.

92
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:40,191
I only see black darkness and emptiness.

93
00:09:40,191 --> 00:09:41,455
Dome.

94
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,378
Try to remember again.

95
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:46,781
Try to think about it.

96
00:09:46,781 --> 00:09:49,800
Try to remember who you are,

97
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,202
where you are from.

98
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,553
Dome.

99
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:14,377
What are you doing?

100
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:16,778
I'm not doing anything.

101
00:10:17,981 --> 00:10:19,178
It's the shadow.

102
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:27,578
What the hell is that?

103
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,978
It's from my dream.

104
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:33,444
Whenever I tried to remember my past as you told me,

105
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,180
The shadow would appear in both my dream and memory.

106
00:10:38,836 --> 00:10:40,778
It means it comes from there.

107
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,580
You need to send it back.

108
00:10:45,735 --> 00:10:48,606
Don...be...

109
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:51,003
Huh?

110
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:52,778

112
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:13,811
Please.

113
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:17,977
Send it back.

114
00:11:33,686 --> 00:11:34,778
Dome.

115
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:36,679

116
00:11:38,273 --> 00:11:39,109
Dome.

117
00:12:20,523 --> 00:12:21,578
What?

118
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,010

119
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:39,130
(Mr. Danuphong Udomsin)

120
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,177
Excuse me.

121
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,351
What is your relationship with the man living in that room?

122
00:12:46,351 --> 00:12:47,509
Why?

123
00:12:47,906 --> 00:12:49,586
Three months ago,

124
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:52,295
something strange happened to the man living in that room.

125
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,009
After a meteor appeared in the sky, he disappeared.

126
00:12:57,533 --> 00:12:59,507
A new man appeared and took his place.

127
00:13:00,594 --> 00:13:03,328
No matter whom you think he is, he is

128
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:06,002
not the same person you used to know.

129
00:13:38,845 --> 00:13:40,206
I'm sorry.

130
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:42,938
Did you have a good dream?

131
00:13:42,938 --> 00:13:44,711
You have been sleeping for a long time.

132
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,477
I haven't had a deep sleep like this for some time.

133
00:13:50,316 --> 00:13:52,523
Now, you are awake. Go pack your bag.

134
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:53,978
Aren't you going to work?

135
00:13:57,676 --> 00:13:58,778
What?

136
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,178
Why me?

137
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:07,808
Why did you ask me to work at the museum?

138
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,614
Do you think I can release you from the curse of immortality?

139
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,380
Do you really think you can help me?

140
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,575
Don't listen to June.

141
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,584
She was born from a story.

142
00:14:54,584 --> 00:14:55,755
So she keeps telling stories.

143
00:15:03,421 --> 00:15:05,603
I'm not cursed.

144
00:15:06,658 --> 00:15:09,580
So I don't need anyone to release me from any curse.

145
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,005
What?

146
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:54,715
Mr. Khatha, I'm at Nisabordee School.

147
00:15:55,492 --> 00:15:57,250
I think one of the cursed artifacts that

148
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:59,420
were stolen from the museum is here.

149
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:11,373
Freeze.

150
00:16:11,373 --> 00:16:13,178
Drop your weapon and show me your hands.

151
00:16:14,966 --> 00:16:16,981
I said drop the weapon and show me your hands.

152
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:21,577
Turn around slowly.

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,555

What the hell are you doing?

161
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,977
What are you shooting?

162
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:36,756
Get up.

What are you guys doing?

167
00:17:49,488 --> 00:17:52,209
Quiet. Other students will hear us.

168
00:18:02,202 --> 00:18:03,456
Stop.

169
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,046
Why are you taking that nerd with us?

170
00:18:08,406 --> 00:18:09,959
I want him to get new experience.

171
00:18:09,984 --> 00:18:13,209
He doesn't have many friends.

172
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:16,363
You are following us like a dog.

173
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,984
Give me your paw.

174
00:18:18,587 --> 00:18:20,378
Stop teasing him.

175
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,408
Why are you shooting the video?

176
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,381
It's exciting.

177
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:28,392

178
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:29,542
If we get caught, it will be evidence against us.

179
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:30,353
Are you stupid?

180
00:18:30,353 --> 00:18:31,909
Right. That's true.

181
00:18:35,895 --> 00:18:40,588
I guarantee that you will love my paradise.

182
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:42,359
I'm anticipating.

183
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:46,060
Welcome to paradise.

Hello.

186
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:58,039

188
00:18:59,628 --> 00:19:00,970
Excuse me.

What?

191
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,864
Drink it.

192
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:05,983
Try it.

193
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:08,380
What's wrong with you?

194
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:11,198
Hello.

195
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:12,659
Hey, baby.

196
00:19:12,659 --> 00:19:15,206
What do you think about my juniors at the basketball club?

197
00:19:15,603 --> 00:19:16,781
Do you like their bodies?

198
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,380
They are so firm.

199
00:19:20,846 --> 00:19:23,696
If any girls are interested in them, please leave your comments.

200
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,696
I'll deliver them to your door.

201
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:28,778
Hey, man.

202
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:32,377
Who are you?

203
00:19:33,894 --> 00:19:35,978
Game, he's my roommate.

204
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,405
I don't want to leave him alone at the dorm.

205
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:38,633
He might feel lonely.

206
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,578
What?!

207
00:19:39,951 --> 00:19:41,578
I told you, didn't I?

208
00:19:41,945 --> 00:19:46,778
This party is only for girls and the members of the basketball club.

209
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,174
How could you take an uninvited guest here?

210
00:19:55,286 --> 00:19:56,013
Hey, man.

211
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:57,103
Stop.

212
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,775
Stop, stop, stop.

213
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:04,778
Do you think you can walk out easily after getting in here?

214
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,377
Since you are here, you need to undergo hazing.

215
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,435
Right?

216
00:20:09,435 --> 00:20:10,777
Let's have fun.

217
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:17,548
Drink it, drink it, drink it.

218
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:23,337
That's so disgusting.

219
00:20:23,337 --> 00:20:24,800
That's enough.

220
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:26,753
Game, you can't let this slide.

221
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:28,440
He barely drank it but already spit it out.

222
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,178
Right. This is not enough.

223
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:33,178
I have another test for him.

224
00:20:34,004 --> 00:20:38,804
Take it off, take it off, take it off.

225
00:20:40,401 --> 00:20:44,378
Take it off, take it off, take it off.

226
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,046
Auto.

227
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:50,752
Take it off, take it off, take it off.

228
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,978
Auto.

229
00:20:55,323 --> 00:20:57,575
Is the babyface going to die?

230
00:21:02,055 --> 00:21:06,141
Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him.

231
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,577
Kiss him.

232
00:21:07,577 --> 00:21:08,387
What are you waiting for?

233
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:11,978
Kiss him.

234
00:21:15,892 --> 00:21:17,304
What the hell are you doing?

235
00:21:17,817 --> 00:21:19,951
Hey, Auto.

236
00:21:22,045 --> 00:21:23,307
Please excuse us.

237
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:27,548
Guys, it's not fun anymore.

238
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:29,575
Let's have fun with something else.

239
00:21:29,803 --> 00:21:31,575
Let's go.

240
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:32,969
Party, let's go.

241
00:21:45,836 --> 00:21:47,789
If you are acting like this,

242
00:21:47,814 --> 00:21:49,796
don't you know that they will bully you more?

243
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,778
It must be hard for you to have a friend like me.

244
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:55,683
Don't take it out on me.

245
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,778
When you are at school, don't be yourself too much.

246
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,378
Otherwise, you can't survive in school.

247
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:05,396
Why are we watching a couple having a fight?

248
00:22:05,936 --> 00:22:10,306
Anyway, isn't there a rumor that Auto is in a weird cult?

249
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,977
How did he know Jay?

250
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:14,113
He never told me that he knows him.

251
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:17,175
Look.

252
00:22:17,175 --> 00:22:18,202
What's that?

253
00:22:18,202 --> 00:22:19,177
What the hell is that?

254
00:22:40,098 --> 00:22:41,148
Auto.

255
00:22:41,148 --> 00:22:41,655
Jay.

256
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:42,078
Auto.

257
00:22:42,078 --> 00:22:42,553
Jay

258
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:43,803
Auto.

259
00:22:44,049 --> 00:22:45,103
Auto.

260
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:46,778
Auto.

261
00:22:47,596 --> 00:22:48,378
Hey?

262
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,778
What's wrong with him?

263
00:22:54,698 --> 00:22:56,052
What?

264
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:04,780
Auto?

265
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:06,893
Auto, do you hear me?

266
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:08,052
Auto.

267
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:10,780
Auto, what's wrong?

268
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:13,592
Jay.

269
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:17,449
Jay.

270
00:23:18,851 --> 00:23:19,646
Jay.

271
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:20,381
Jay.

272
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,583
Jay.

273
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:22,778
Jay.

274
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:26,378
What the hell did you do, Auto?

275
00:23:28,594 --> 00:23:30,673
Auto.

276
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:32,377
Calm down, Auto.

277
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,452
Don't come closer.

278
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:36,514
Run.

279
00:23:36,514 --> 00:23:37,610
Run now.

280
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,775
I'm sorry, Auto.

281
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,178
Stay away from me.

282
00:24:13,936 --> 00:24:14,819
Auto.

283
00:24:20,824 --> 00:24:22,110
Where is Game?

284
00:24:25,258 --> 00:24:27,420
Point the camera at her.

285
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,778
Don't show my face on the camera.

286
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:33,322
What's that?

287
00:24:33,322 --> 00:24:34,695
What the hell?

288
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:36,578
Sh...

289
00:24:36,578 --> 00:24:37,787
Auto.

290
00:24:50,374 --> 00:24:51,581
You are dead.

291
00:24:52,896 --> 00:24:54,739
You are the one who will be dead.

292
00:24:58,316 --> 00:24:59,978
Game.

293
00:25:00,336 --> 00:25:01,225
Stay away from me.

294
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:02,064
I didn't do anything to you.

295
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,578
Auto, we didn't do anything.

296
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:20,040
These are videos from CCTV cameras, social media,

297
00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:23,978
and the victims' phones that we have collected.

298
00:25:26,406 --> 00:25:28,227
Do you have anything to say?

299
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,302
What are you doing?

300
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:20,378
This case is too big for me to simply return the artifact to you.

301
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:23,948
The suspect is also a minor.

302
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:27,017
We need to wait for a psychologist and his parents to be here first.

303
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:30,608
I can't question him or investigate the case yet.

304
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:33,458
So I need to seize it in the meantime.

305
00:26:38,828 --> 00:26:39,584
Take it.

306
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:44,378
So why are you showing it to me?

307
00:26:45,027 --> 00:26:46,640
Where are the teachers?

308
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,977
Why aren't they here to take care of their student?

309
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:51,494
They kept saying that he is a monster.

310
00:26:51,494 --> 00:26:53,664
None of them wanted to come here.

311
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,778
This phone likely belongs to the thief who escaped.

312
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:12,840
We haven't found him.

313
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,580
We only found the artifacts stolen from the museum.

314
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:19,178
You need to confirm with the officer that they are the stolen artifacts.

315
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:21,578
Then I'll begin the process to return them to you.

316
00:27:21,993 --> 00:27:25,180
Can you take me to see the artifacts that you found?

317
00:27:26,768 --> 00:27:29,983
I need to go to the toilet.

318
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,956
He's an adult. He can find his way to the toilet.

319
00:27:44,956 --> 00:27:46,781
You don't need to worry about him.

320
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,178
Just lead the way.

321
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,170
(Home)

322
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,802
(Home?)

323
00:29:45,353 --> 00:29:46,777
(What do you mean?)

324
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,810
(You have a mission to do.)

325
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:52,778
(A mission?)

326
00:29:52,935 --> 00:29:54,593
(What mission?)

327
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:56,377
(What do I need to do?)

328
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,650
(Your mission is...)

329
00:30:13,399 --> 00:30:14,842
What are you doing here?

330
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:15,737
Get out.

331
00:30:15,737 --> 00:30:17,221
You can't come in here.

332
00:30:20,122 --> 00:30:22,771
It was my fault. I didn't give him detailed directions to the toilet.

333
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:25,180
So Dome accidentally went into the evidence room.

334
00:30:30,635 --> 00:30:32,377
Can you stop being sarcastic?

335
00:30:36,528 --> 00:30:39,578
What did you do in the evidence room?

336
00:30:57,583 --> 00:30:58,778
What will happen to that boy?

337
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:01,927
He commits homicide.

338
00:31:01,927 --> 00:31:04,208
It's a non-compoundable offense.

339
00:31:05,312 --> 00:31:06,859
I hope you won't use your connections

340
00:31:06,884 --> 00:31:08,531
to help him get away from the charges.

341
00:31:09,497 --> 00:31:10,777
I got it.

342
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:14,380
This time, I won't intervene in your case.

343
00:33:00,587 --> 00:33:01,900
This is your room.

344
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,178
What's wrong?

345
00:33:14,107 --> 00:33:16,778
You don't respond when I talk to you.

346
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,808
It's nothing.

347
00:33:20,476 --> 00:33:22,778
Your eyes cannot lie when your words are.

348
00:33:25,006 --> 00:33:27,578
I won't force you if you don't want to talk about it.

349
00:33:28,732 --> 00:33:31,803
If you trust me, you can tell me.

350
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:34,778
Maybe there is something I can help with.

351
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,408
Mr. Khatha.

352
00:33:43,678 --> 00:33:45,578
The rock talked to me.

353
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,978
It told me to go closer to it.

354
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:53,408
When I picked it up, I felt like it was trying to communicate with me.

355
00:33:53,972 --> 00:33:57,578
It said I came from a faraway land.

356
00:33:57,713 --> 00:33:59,978
I came here to do a mission.

357
00:34:01,978 --> 00:34:03,578
What is the mission?

358
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:05,145
I don't know.

359
00:34:05,145 --> 00:34:07,180
I was caught before it told me.

360
00:34:16,463 --> 00:34:17,435
Come here.

361
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:19,174
What are you doing?

362
00:34:20,783 --> 00:34:22,244
I'm checking.

363
00:34:24,966 --> 00:34:27,009
Whether you are being possessed by the stone.

364
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:40,778
Dome.

365
00:34:41,145 --> 00:34:45,583
That stone has enormous power of the universe circulating in it.

366
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:48,691
It will possess anyone who is in contact with it

367
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,490
and bring out the darkest side of that person.

368
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,209
It will destroy everything.

369
00:34:55,649 --> 00:34:58,202
Promise me that you will never touch it again.

370
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:03,008
Yes, I promise.

371
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,380
What?

372
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:23,707
I'm sorry to call you at this late hour.

373
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,375
Bam called me and said that the boy ran away.

374
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:28,375
He also took the rock with him.

375
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,981
What the hell was your friend doing to...

376
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,717
Hello?

377
00:35:45,841 --> 00:35:47,978
Even though I tell you not to go,

378
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,378
you will find a way to go anyway.

379
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:53,349
Yes.

380
00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:55,183
Then you need to be in my sight.

381
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:57,281
Don't go out of my sight.

382
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,286
Do you get it?

383
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:10,781
Is there anyone hear me?

384
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,461
Open the door for me.

385
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,823
Please let me in.

386
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:17,500
Jay.

387
00:36:18,532 --> 00:36:20,377
You are still alive?

388
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:22,208
I was dead.

389
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:23,980
But I woke up from death.

390
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,780
The power of the rock brought me back to life.

391
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:31,061
Where are we going?

392
00:36:31,061 --> 00:36:31,924
I'm not going.

393
00:36:31,924 --> 00:36:33,578
Where are you taking me?

394
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:37,996
Jay.

395
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:39,583
Where are you taking me?

396
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:42,963
If the rock can bring dead people back to life,

397
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,006
why don't we tell the museum's owner about it?

398
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:50,380
Why do you want to tell him about it?

399
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:53,215
Jay.

400
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:54,505
Let me go.

401
00:36:54,751 --> 00:36:55,811
You're hurting me.

402
00:37:07,408 --> 00:37:09,002
I'll take it.

403
00:37:10,886 --> 00:37:16,781
By the way, how does this rock work?

404
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:20,377
Jay, please don't hurt me.

405
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:21,580
I'm begging you.

406
00:37:24,757 --> 00:37:26,716
You believe in the rock, don't you?

407
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,177
You said you believe in him.

408
00:37:32,279 --> 00:37:33,578
Then test it.

409
00:37:33,903 --> 00:37:35,980
You should die and wake up from death like me.

410
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,230
So you will know.

411
00:37:44,442 --> 00:37:45,827
What's wrong, Auto?

412
00:38:03,503 --> 00:38:04,778
Stop.

413
00:38:05,415 --> 00:38:07,177
You promised me that you would stay away from it.

414
00:38:58,916 --> 00:38:59,980
Dome.

415
00:39:02,282 --> 00:39:03,581
Dome.

416
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:06,502
Dome.

417
00:39:09,577 --> 00:39:10,775
Get a hold of yourself, Dome.

418
00:39:16,003 --> 00:39:16,778
Dome.

419
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:19,907
It's me.

420
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:37,903
Can you hear me?

421
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,403
Mr. Khatha.

422
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,380
Dome.

423
00:39:47,384 --> 00:39:48,700
Dome.

424
00:39:53,947 --> 00:39:55,180
Come back to me.

425
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:33,578
It seems that a part of the power of the rock still possesses him.

426
00:41:07,346 --> 00:41:09,578
You will be in this state for a while.

427
00:41:12,685 --> 00:41:15,000
Until the power of the rock completely withdraws from you.

428
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:20,378
I almost killed you.

429
00:41:27,138 --> 00:41:28,778
I'm immortal.

430
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,721
You cannot kill me.

431
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:32,377
Don't you remember that?

432
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:34,777
Even so.

433
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:38,073
I lost account of how many times

434
00:41:38,098 --> 00:41:41,999
I couldn't control myself and killed people.

435
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,305
This thing will happen again.

436
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:53,980
Then what do you want me to do?

437
00:42:16,443 --> 00:42:17,977
It's done.

438
00:42:20,034 --> 00:42:21,578
Are you sure this is a good idea?

439
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,780
It's Dome's decision.

440
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,375
In the upcoming auction,

441
00:42:57,267 --> 00:42:58,780
We need to get that item.

442
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,002
(On the 6th day of the waxing moon of the 7th lunar month of Chulasakarat 1182)

443
00:43:11,027 --> 00:43:12,674

Midnight Museum: The Terrestrial Rock

450
00:45:16,149 --> 00:45:19,609
The item that you plan to bid on in the auction can save Dome, can't it?

451
00:45:19,609 --> 00:45:21,578
The necklace has a salt crystal.

452
00:45:21,913 --> 00:45:24,356
In ancient times, salt was believed to be a pure substance

453
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:26,409
and could absorb dark power.

454
00:45:26,484 --> 00:45:27,533
Bee, why don't you have a meal with me?

455
00:45:27,533 --> 00:45:28,650
I don't want to.

456
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,515
You.

457
00:45:29,515 --> 00:45:31,553
You took my dad away from me and my mom.

458
00:45:31,553 --> 00:45:35,975
A slut like you is nothing compared to my mom.

459
00:45:36,086 --> 00:45:38,101
Hold the knife tightly in your hand.

460
00:45:38,101 --> 00:45:42,490
Use it on the person you want to disappear.
