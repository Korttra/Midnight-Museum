1
00:00:00,115 --> 00:00:01,740
Do not leave anyone behind!

2
00:00:01,903 --> 00:00:03,223
One last question...

3
00:00:03,808 --> 00:00:05,508
Who killed the witch?

4
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:06,943
I did.

5
00:00:06,943 --> 00:00:08,422
I killed the witch.

6
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,074
I killed my brother.

7
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,579
Lord, please forgive me.

8
00:00:16,832 --> 00:00:20,379
Now, I'm aware of the sin that I committed.

9
00:00:21,357 --> 00:00:24,022
I did it because my consciousness was temporarily blinded.

10
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,508
Please have mercy on me.

11
00:00:32,186 --> 00:00:34,779
What sin did you commit, Anthika?

12
00:00:39,693 --> 00:00:43,219
You arbitrarily associated yourself with the devils.

13
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,108
You reached your hands out to temptation.

14
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:56,376
You almost ruined God's plan.

15
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:02,417
There's only one God for me.

16
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,817
You are my God.

17
00:01:06,115 --> 00:01:08,428
I hope that the punishment you received this time

18
00:01:08,453 --> 00:01:11,530
will restore your faith in God.

19
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,579
I hope that this sunless darkness

20
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,379
will make you understand God's timing.

21
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:27,579
You are my God.

22
00:01:29,758 --> 00:01:32,379
You are my God.

23
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,017
You are my God.

24
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,019
Eat the fish.

25
00:01:48,838 --> 00:01:50,419
I caught it myself.

26
00:01:52,266 --> 00:01:53,980
What's wrong?

27
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,579
I am also without a companion nor family.

28
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:12,020
Would it be impertinent of me to think of you as my brother?

29
00:02:19,423 --> 00:02:24,019
Can I call you Khatha?

30
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:29,980
Why do you want to call me Khatha as in a scepter?

31
00:02:32,231 --> 00:02:37,179
You have been using a cane to support yourself.

32
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,982
But from now on, you no longer need it.

33
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:44,379
I think...

34
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,019
...you can support yourself now.

35
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:53,979
You can use your body to do great things.

36
00:02:54,234 --> 00:02:56,380
You are your own scepter.

37
00:02:59,431 --> 00:03:00,645
You.

38
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:04,819
Do you understand what I am saying?

39
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:07,912
I don't understand it at all.

40
00:03:12,834 --> 00:03:15,005
But I like the name that you pick for me.

41
00:03:15,682 --> 00:03:16,819
It sounds very odd.

42
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:26,417
Then I'll call you Chan as in the moon.

43
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,977
Because I found you under the moonlight.

44
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:33,620
The name sounds so outdated.

45
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,490
You don't need to compliment me on that.

46
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,579
Outdated.

47
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,208
You should eat the eggplant.

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:53,980
Try the fish.

49
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:03,577
They look like loving brothers.

50
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:08,379
Why?

51
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,619
Are you jealous?

52
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,579
I can think of you as my brother too.

53
00:04:21,885 --> 00:04:24,019
Don't pretend as if you were mad.

54
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:27,577
I only said what is in your head.

55
00:04:29,786 --> 00:04:31,219
Don't forget.

56
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:36,019
I'm just an illusion from your imagination.

57
00:04:43,468 --> 00:04:45,617
This place is quite beautiful.

58
00:04:47,217 --> 00:04:49,179
It's not that bad.

59
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,217
I wish that you were here with me.

60
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,777
The time here is a bit strange.

61
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,419
I can't tell how many days and nights have passed.

62
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:08,379
I don't want to live here.

63
00:05:09,493 --> 00:05:12,019
Have you ever thought about escaping from this place?

64
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:21,014
What do you know about this place?

65
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:28,819
The One said...

66
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:31,219
...this place is called the Limbo.

67
00:05:31,927 --> 00:05:33,617
It's a temporal rift.

68
00:05:41,484 --> 00:05:44,379
What do you think this place is?

69
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:01,179
Is this place the museum?

70
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:13,179
Do you think these items can help you escape from here?

71
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,382
Khatha.

72
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,019
Mr. Khatha.

73
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,792
Are you still worried about your looks?

74
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:07,219
We already knew everything about you.

75
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:12,601
What?

76
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:17,554
Bam.

77
00:07:17,554 --> 00:07:18,617
Huh?

78
00:07:19,253 --> 00:07:20,902
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:21,448 --> 00:07:22,777
What?

80
00:07:24,364 --> 00:07:26,419
I'm sorry that I couldn't save you.

81
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,022
I'm sorry, Triphob.

82
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:40,819
June.

83
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,767
That happened for more than a week.

84
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,180
Forget about it

85
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,208
So?

86
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,780
Do we have any new information?

87
00:08:13,737 --> 00:08:15,576
The logo on Anthika's business card.

88
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:18,918
It's the logo of the Eternity cult.

89
00:08:18,918 --> 00:08:21,620
It was the crime scene of the terrestrial rock case last month.

90
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:24,474
I'll send someone to inspect the place.

91
00:08:24,474 --> 00:08:26,419
I'll let you know as soon as I have new updates.

92
00:08:27,142 --> 00:08:28,819
What about you?

93
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:31,219
Did you get any new information from these documents?

94
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:39,008
Not much.

95
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,979
I don't understand what The One said at all.

96
00:08:43,146 --> 00:08:46,779
You mean his words that Dome is here but not right here?

97
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,620
Whose phone is ringing?

98
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,299
Hello.

99
00:09:22,503 --> 00:09:23,976
Hel...o...

100
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:25,222
Hello.

101
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:27,000
Dome.

102
00:09:27,164 --> 00:09:27,888
Khatha.

103
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:28,779
Mr. Khatha.

104
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:31,179
Is that you?

105
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:33,579
I'm...in a rif...

106
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,497
I'm stuck in a temporal rift.

107
00:09:36,497 --> 00:09:37,663
Huh?

108
00:09:37,663 --> 00:09:38,764
Dome.

109
00:09:38,764 --> 00:09:40,237
What did you say?

110
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:42,019
Where are you stuck in?

111
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,417
I'm stuck in the Limbo.

112
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:46,417
Huh?

113
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,708
I'm stuck in the Limbo.

114
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:48,693
Dome.

115
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:50,693
Dome.

116
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:53,401
Dome.

117
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,008
Dome.

118
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,100
Dome.

126
00:10:46,349 --> 00:10:52,105
It's believed that every substance has a resonant frequency.

127
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:54,490
Not only the substances on earth

128
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,091
but also the substances in the entire universe.

129
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,779
Whether it is the sun,

130
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:01,179
the moon, or other planets.

131
00:11:01,352 --> 00:11:03,579
They all have their own resonant frequencies.

132
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,179
You still don't understand what I'm saying, do you?

133
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,579
For example, this pen.

134
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,979
This pen has its resonant frequency.

135
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:14,379
My body also has its resonant frequency.

136
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:16,975
These frequencies always have effects

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,880
and are connected to each other.

138
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,579
I didn't buy this pen because I think it's pretty.

139
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:25,922
Maybe I bought it because its frequency

140
00:11:25,947 --> 00:11:28,803
is in sync with my body's frequency.

141
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,179
It attracted me to this pen.

142
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:33,579
So I decided to buy it.

143
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,840
Wait.

144
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:50,644
Hey.

145
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:57,579
Do you remember the payphone?

146
00:11:58,522 --> 00:11:59,847
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

147
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,727
Aren't you going to say hi to me first?

148
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,779
I'm in a hurry.

149
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:07,179
Do you remember anything about it?

150
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:32,417
Of course.

151
00:12:38,305 --> 00:12:40,214
Why are you lying that you didn't call me?

152
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:44,419
I'm not lying. I didn't call you.

153
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:46,318
You know that I don't like talking over the phone.

154
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:47,979
Then why would call you?

155
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,219
You did call me.

156
00:12:49,711 --> 00:12:54,020
You called me and asked me what date it was.

157
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:56,180
Last night, you sounded pretty bad.

158
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,819
You were drunk and sobbing.

159
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,179
Follow the signal.

160
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:04,437
Follow it.

161
00:13:04,437 --> 00:13:06,019
That was what you said.

162
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:08,019
You are talking nonsense.

163
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,408
I told you that I didn't call you.

164
00:13:10,768 --> 00:13:13,219
I was at home last night. How could I get drunk?

165
00:13:16,801 --> 00:13:18,019
That's true.

166
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:22,816
When you were at home,

167
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:25,737
Didn't you have a craving for a drink?

168
00:13:26,874 --> 00:13:28,779
Nonsense.

169
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:32,419
Forget about it.

170
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,977
You weren't drunk but I am.

171
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,699
I'm drunk...

172
00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:39,594
Stop it.

173
00:13:39,594 --> 00:13:42,019
If you are going to say that you are drunk in love, then don't say it.

174
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:44,419
I told you many times that it's not funny.

175
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,219
But I am drunk.

176
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:57,579
Don't you believe me?

177
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:03,619
You are doing it again.

178
00:14:05,531 --> 00:14:07,183
You know I like you.

179
00:14:07,694 --> 00:14:10,819
If you like me too, why don't you agree to be my boyfriend?

180
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:14,379
I'm tired of putting moves on you.

181
00:14:20,204 --> 00:14:21,579
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

182
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:26,380
Today is my birthday but you didn't prepare any gifts.

183
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,271
Instead, you are teasing me.

184
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:28,334
Tum!

185
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:37,908
Tum, Phone is dead.

186
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:43,955
(According to the Mayan Calendar, today is doomsday.)

187
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,780
(We are not sure if it's really going to happen.)

188
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:52,302
(But what will happen tonight is a total lunar eclipse.)

189
00:14:52,687 --> 00:14:53,979
(Moving on to the next news.)

190
00:14:59,782 --> 00:15:01,179
Dad, the power went off.

191
00:15:03,632 --> 00:15:04,819
Dad.

192
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:01,180
Follow the signal.

193
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,850
Follow it.

194
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:05,401
Follow the signal.

195
00:16:54,331 --> 00:16:55,179
Hello.

196
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:58,820
Tum, what day is today?

197
00:17:00,518 --> 00:17:02,379
How did you know who I am?

198
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,617
I have no time to explain it.

199
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:04,779
What day is today?

200
00:17:07,257 --> 00:17:10,222
21 December 2012.

201
00:17:10,472 --> 00:17:11,979
How many moons are there in the sky?

202
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,142
Of course, there's only one moon.

203
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:15,317
Who are you?

204
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,779
My name is Nonthakon Phanpho.

205
00:17:16,863 --> 00:17:19,179
I was born on 19 December 1991.

206
00:17:19,257 --> 00:17:19,786
I am currently...

207
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:22,242
Nonthakorn Phanpho is my name.

208
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:23,237
Who are you?

209
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:25,370
I don't know what I need to do to make you believe me.

210
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,426
I'm calling you on 4 April 2023

211
00:17:28,426 --> 00:17:29,755
I'm 31 years old.

212
00:17:29,755 --> 00:17:32,881
The payphone that you are using can make a call to the past.

213
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:34,345
Use it to call Phone.

214
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,128
Call him. It's the only way. Do you hear me?

215
00:17:36,948 --> 00:17:37,706
Hello?

216
00:17:38,075 --> 00:17:38,724
Hello?

217
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:40,213
Hello?

218
00:17:49,512 --> 00:17:53,417
Does this mean the future you called yourself in the past?

219
00:17:54,805 --> 00:17:56,419
I don't know.

220
00:17:57,297 --> 00:17:58,822
I don't know what that man wanted.

221
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:01,219
I don't understand his question about the moon.

222
00:18:03,579 --> 00:18:06,019
What did you do after that?

223
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:11,980
When I realized that the payphone could make a call to the past,

224
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:15,619
I thought I could change the past.

225
00:18:28,325 --> 00:18:29,405
Hello.

226
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:32,419
Hello, Phone.

227
00:18:33,468 --> 00:18:35,979
Did someone die? Why are you calling me at 3 am?

228
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,219
Are you crying?

229
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:51,619
Did someone really die?

230
00:18:53,525 --> 00:18:54,604
No.

231
00:18:57,765 --> 00:18:58,819
Phone.

232
00:19:00,074 --> 00:19:01,219
What year is this year?

233
00:19:01,404 --> 00:19:03,001
2010.

234
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,407
Are you happy now?

235
00:19:10,223 --> 00:19:11,411
Yes.

236
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,379
I'm very happy.

237
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:17,408
If you are happy, can I go back to sleep now?

238
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,419
Good night. Bye.

239
00:19:21,395 --> 00:19:22,819
Bye.

240
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:24,605
Good night.

241
00:19:33,488 --> 00:19:35,979
His voice gave me some hope.

242
00:19:42,693 --> 00:19:44,985
When I asked you about our phone calls,

243
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,823
why did you say you didn't call me?

244
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,379
I don't know.

245
00:19:50,922 --> 00:19:52,241
I was scared, I guess.

246
00:19:52,241 --> 00:19:53,706
What were you scared of?

247
00:19:53,706 --> 00:19:55,182
You can tell me anything.

248
00:20:03,114 --> 00:20:04,779
I wish you were here with me.

249
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:08,419
Where are you?

250
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:10,819
Do you want me to go see you?

251
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:13,219
You can't find me.

252
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,620
Why?

253
00:20:16,785 --> 00:20:18,019
Then use your imagination.

254
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,979
I'm doing it.

255
00:20:42,328 --> 00:20:43,804
Happy New Year.

256
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,557
What New Year?

257
00:20:46,557 --> 00:20:48,902
It's more than 10 days before the new year arrives.

258
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:50,902
Phone.

259
00:20:51,401 --> 00:20:52,779
What day is today?

260
00:20:54,042 --> 00:20:55,179
Are you alright?

261
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,579
Today is the 18th.

262
00:20:57,837 --> 00:21:01,220
Tomorrow is 19 December, your birthday.

263
00:21:01,882 --> 00:21:04,779
Tum, I prepared a gift to surprise you.

264
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,333
What year is this year?

265
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,358
How old am I this year?

266
00:21:10,358 --> 00:21:11,414
Huh?

267
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:15,616
This year is 2012.

268
00:21:16,851 --> 00:21:19,179
You are turning 21 this year.

269
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,002
Don't go see me tomorrow.

270
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:31,856
Why?

271
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:34,819
My dad told me to go to Ayutthaya to see him.

272
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:35,979
I won't be able to meet you.

273
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:39,619
See you later.

274
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,780
I rushed to Phone's house.

275
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,179
I thought I would see him there.

276
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:58,817
Was he there?

277
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:02,382
No.

278
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:07,179
But it didn't mean that my effort was wasted.

279
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:25,223
Tum, this is Phone's mother.

280
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,779
I couldn't reach you.

281
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,179
So I looked up in Phone's contact list.

282
00:22:31,374 --> 00:22:33,580
I found another number saved under your name.

283
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:37,219
Tum.

284
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:39,619
Phone...

285
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:42,017
Phone is dead.

286
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:46,985
He went near a construction site...

287
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,960
On the day that I thought I could save my loved one.

288
00:23:00,737 --> 00:23:02,419
I put him through greater pain.

289
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:05,979
I was trying to save him several times.

290
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:09,619
But I got three different results.

291
00:23:11,517 --> 00:23:13,179
Either he was killed at a construction site,

292
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,820
Or he was drowned.

293
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:19,995
I followed the signal.

294
00:23:19,995 --> 00:23:22,259
It led me to this payphone.

295
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:24,020
So there should be a way that I could save your life.

296
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:26,419
Or he met with the same ending.

297
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,222
He was hit by a car.

298
00:23:32,379 --> 00:23:33,724
You need to follow the signal.

299
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:36,019
You told him to follow the signal. Do you hear me?

300
00:23:56,755 --> 00:23:57,579
Scoot over.

301
00:23:58,198 --> 00:23:59,980
I need to use the phone.

302
00:24:02,382 --> 00:24:04,154
I'm using it.

303
00:24:04,154 --> 00:24:06,019
I'm waiting for a call.

304
00:24:07,397 --> 00:24:08,419
Don't you have a mobile phone?

305
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,979
Until the day that I met you.

306
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:22,819
Dead people can never call us back.

307
00:24:25,103 --> 00:24:26,382
When people are dead,

308
00:24:26,816 --> 00:24:28,382
they are gone.

309
00:24:28,382 --> 00:24:30,019
I've never seen anyone come back from death.

310
00:24:53,727 --> 00:24:55,179
Aren't you going to answer it?

311
00:24:55,288 --> 00:24:56,419
No.

312
00:24:57,026 --> 00:24:58,819
It's usually a prank call.

313
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:01,789
Here is your order.

314
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:07,177
Do you know what?

315
00:25:08,331 --> 00:25:10,819
There are many things that I want to tell him.

316
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:14,379
I want to thank him.

317
00:25:15,785 --> 00:25:16,779
I want to apologize to him.

318
00:25:18,078 --> 00:25:20,419
I want to tell him face to face.

319
00:25:20,712 --> 00:25:21,579
Do you know what I mean?

320
00:25:32,687 --> 00:25:34,822
Maybe it's better this way.

321
00:25:40,848 --> 00:25:42,019
Something,

322
00:25:42,425 --> 00:25:43,903
Someone,

323
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:46,819
Or some story,

324
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,810
When they are gone,

325
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:53,382
they are just the past.

326
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:55,179
Of course, it hurts.

327
00:25:57,768 --> 00:25:59,980
But you need to find a way to live with it.

328
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:10,100
Maybe it's better this way.

329
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:18,019
It's the best thing that we can stand on our own feet.

330
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:21,579
It's better that we didn't make it even worse.

331
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,607
Go back and focus on school.

332
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:39,619
Forget about the payphone.

333
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:43,179
Pretend like none of this ever happened.

334
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,579
I can never forget it.

335
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:03,617
After that day, I can't find that payphone again.

336
00:27:04,974 --> 00:27:07,179
No matter how hard I tried.

337
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:10,819
I decided to study in Thailand.

338
00:27:11,735 --> 00:27:13,965
I gave up my scholarship and opportunities to study abroad.

339
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:18,019
I held on to my forlorn hope that one day I would meet him again.

340
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:22,819
But that day never came.

341
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:30,019
There was a reason why the payphone disappeared.

342
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:51,622
I think it's time to bring back the old memories.

343
00:27:54,509 --> 00:27:59,979
All this time, the person who has been keeping the payphone is...

344
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:35,977
Hey.

345
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:39,619
How did you make that phone call?

346
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:41,619
You didn't know the number.

347
00:28:42,008 --> 00:28:43,807
You also didn't have any coins.

348
00:28:46,377 --> 00:28:50,379
I just focused on it and intensely stared at it.

349
00:28:55,434 --> 00:28:56,420
Come here.

350
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,379
So did you find the answer?

351
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,884
To the question that June asked you at the amusement park.

352
00:29:17,884 --> 00:29:19,884
About...

353
00:29:22,197 --> 00:29:23,979
...your goal in life.

354
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,204
At first,

355
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:33,579
my goal in life was to find out who I am.

356
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:39,617
The more I tried to search for the answer, the more questions I have.

357
00:29:46,377 --> 00:29:49,220
I think you should stop searching for who you are.

358
00:29:50,802 --> 00:29:54,019
Instead, you should try to see what you can do.

359
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,201
You have a magic power to start with.

360
00:29:59,032 --> 00:30:04,779
Why don't you think about what you can do with that power?

361
00:30:05,571 --> 00:30:07,900
The power that I can't fully control it?

362
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:15,619
Then train yourself.

363
00:30:16,303 --> 00:30:18,019
You have a lot of free time here.

364
00:30:19,752 --> 00:30:21,005
I'll help you.

365
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:28,779
Come on.

366
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:37,177
You used the power before, right?

367
00:30:39,158 --> 00:30:41,115
I thought about the moths

368
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,219
and I saw what happened.

369
00:30:46,885 --> 00:30:51,579
It means the power could connect you to other people.

370
00:30:53,654 --> 00:30:56,379
Think about the person that you are longing for.

371
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:17,979
Do you see anything?

372
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:21,619
I see you...

373
00:31:26,192 --> 00:31:27,579
...being hit.

374
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,420
I don't know where Dome is.

375
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,979
But I need to bring him back.

376
00:31:46,777 --> 00:31:48,019
I'm sorry about earlier.

377
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,450
I deserved it.

378
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,962
Do you know what?

379
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,977
I was able to get my doctoral degree because of it.

380
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:12,019
I was getting ready for the day that I would find it again.

381
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:15,053
I hope that I would be smart enough to know how to use it.

382
00:32:18,231 --> 00:32:22,208
That's why I asked for your help.

383
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:33,619
Do what you want to do.

384
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,780
I'll wait outside.

385
00:32:47,447 --> 00:32:48,505
How was it?

386
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:49,602
What else did you see?

387
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:55,804
I saw Mr. Khatha doing something with a payphone.

388
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,220
This belonged to Mr. Khatha.

389
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:35,472
Why are you making that facial expression?

390
00:33:35,472 --> 00:33:37,895
My boss reduced the manpower in my unit.

391
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,700
He said they need more officers to work on missing teenager cases.

392
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,622
I was also scolded for obsessing with Khatha's case.

393
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:49,179
I'm sorry on Mr. Khatha's behalf.

394
00:33:49,484 --> 00:33:52,819
Phob, you need to stop apologizing on his behalf

395
00:33:52,918 --> 00:33:55,219
I'm frustrated every time I see you do that.

396
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:00,017
Anyway, I'll investigate the case by myself.

397
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:05,979
I don't think you should investigate this case by yourself.

398
00:34:07,484 --> 00:34:08,860
It's just a stakeout.

399
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,740
I can do it by myself.

400
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,779
I said no.

401
00:34:12,414 --> 00:34:13,179
Bam.

402
00:34:15,557 --> 00:34:17,980
I will never lose you again.

403
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,780
When everything is over,

404
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:27,579
and Mr. Khatha is able to rescue Mr. Dome,

405
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:30,708
I'll go talk to him.

406
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:34,779
So you will stay out of this.

407
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,105
Hey.

408
00:34:39,472 --> 00:34:41,072
It's not that dangerous.

409
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:41,977
No.

410
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,019
I made up my mind.

411
00:34:49,299 --> 00:34:51,579
I can't let you be in danger because of me again.

412
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:55,219
Phob.

413
00:34:55,721 --> 00:34:57,619
You know how stubborn I can be.

414
00:35:00,013 --> 00:35:02,420
If I decide to be there for someone,

415
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:04,819
I will never let his hand go.

416
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:08,379
I will fight with him until the end.

417
00:35:14,568 --> 00:35:17,408
After everything is over,

418
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,780
- We should... - Triphob.

419
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,419
Did you finish arranging the parcels?

420
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,379
Do you have something for me to do?

421
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,659
I want you to give Tum a ride.

422
00:35:35,684 --> 00:35:37,214
He has something that he needs.

423
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:40,819
I'll make phone calls to buy the other things that he needs.

424
00:35:42,491 --> 00:35:43,706
Yes.

425
00:36:04,645 --> 00:36:05,905
You can wait here.

426
00:36:05,905 --> 00:36:07,222
I'll be right back.

427
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,971
(Phone's mom just found this box.)

428
00:36:55,971 --> 00:37:00,019
(She said Phone prepared this to give to you on your 19th birthday.)

429
00:37:00,277 --> 00:37:02,419
(She apologized for giving it to you so late.)

430
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,650
(Watch the video on the phone.)

431
00:37:45,769 --> 00:37:46,565
Hello.

432
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,980
Happy Birthday.

433
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:50,379
I saw you were talking about it.

434
00:37:50,379 --> 00:37:51,620
I got it for you.

435
00:37:52,348 --> 00:37:54,019
Don't use it to do anything strange.

436
00:37:56,350 --> 00:38:00,895
The company recalled the phone because they found some defects.

437
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,776
It doesn't worth it if it blows up while you are using it.

438
00:38:10,762 --> 00:38:12,957
I wish you all the happiness in life.

439
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,379
Don't be stressed out.

440
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,222
Make sure to get some rest.

441
00:38:16,857 --> 00:38:21,580
I know that you must have many important things in your life.

442
00:38:22,928 --> 00:38:25,219
It's okay that we can't see each other.

443
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:27,619
I'll miss you.

444
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,422
You can call me anytime, Tum.

445
00:38:34,568 --> 00:38:35,979
I love you.

446
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:40,779
Bye.

447
00:39:17,626 --> 00:39:19,179
Let's hurry back to the museum.

448
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:43,179
Does this means I can call myself in the past?

449
00:39:48,631 --> 00:39:50,379
If you call yourself in the past and warn him about it,

450
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,779
You may be able to fix everything.

451
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:56,419
It won't work.

452
00:39:57,281 --> 00:39:58,819
If you don't believe me, you can try it.

453
00:40:37,188 --> 00:40:38,380
Aren't you going to answer it?

454
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:39,619
No.

455
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,019
It's usually a prank call.

456
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:46,819
Bad habit.

457
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,377
Give me another coin.

458
00:40:51,524 --> 00:40:53,245
The first rule of traveling to the past.

459
00:40:53,601 --> 00:40:57,068
If you try to change the past, it will resist.

460
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,979
It won't let you change things easily.

461
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:50,379
Dome.

462
00:41:55,115 --> 00:41:56,420
Are you okay?

463
00:41:56,656 --> 00:41:57,579
Are you alright?

464
00:41:59,063 --> 00:41:59,700
Dome.

465
00:41:59,914 --> 00:42:00,502
Dome.

466
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:01,219
Dome.

467
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:02,377
Dome.

468
00:42:04,998 --> 00:42:06,019
Dome.

469
00:42:08,368 --> 00:42:10,819
There are two things that I didn't tell you that day.

470
00:42:12,245 --> 00:42:14,379
Every time I called Phone.

471
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,179
I took note of the dates I made the call and he answered the call.

472
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,579
Hello, Phone.

473
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,219
What day is today?

474
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:27,219
What time is it now?

475
00:42:30,702 --> 00:42:32,097
Why are you asking me that?

476
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:33,580
Just answer me.

477
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:38,380
14 June 2011.

478
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:42,017
3.18 pm.

479
00:42:43,182 --> 00:42:44,379
Okay.

480
00:42:48,285 --> 00:42:50,900
2 January 2010.

481
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:54,127
7.12 am.

482
00:42:59,435 --> 00:43:02,379
17 April 2012.

483
00:43:05,617 --> 00:43:07,180
5.34 pm.

484
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:16,497
I processed the data in the computer by using a formula.

485
00:43:16,497 --> 00:43:19,179
I wanted to know when I should make the call,

486
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,305
if I wanted to call him at a particular date and time,

487
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,842
The point is...

488
00:43:26,867 --> 00:43:31,206
I don't think that Dome is in the past.

489
00:43:35,161 --> 00:43:37,219
The other thing I didn't tell you is...

490
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,779
A few years after you took the payphone away from me,

491
00:43:40,779 --> 00:43:43,922
I met Phone's mom.

492
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,053
She seemed to be unable to remember Phone's accident

493
00:43:49,078 --> 00:43:50,794
at the construction site or his drowning.

494
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,179
I still believed that what she told me over the phone was real.

495
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:58,822
When I tried to call Phone earlier, it turned out that...

496
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:02,379
Do what you want to do.

497
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,309
I'll wait outside.

498
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:38,382
Hello.

499
00:44:38,382 --> 00:44:42,019
I haven't seen this number for a long time.

500
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:45,579
How are you doing?

501
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:49,219
I'm fine.

502
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:50,327
What about you?

503
00:44:50,327 --> 00:44:51,622
How are you doing?

504
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:55,971
I'm doing okay.

505
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:58,819
It's good to hear that.

506
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:04,779
About our meeting on your birthday, is it still on?

507
00:45:19,897 --> 00:45:21,579
Of course.

508
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:25,219
I desperately want to meet you.

509
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:28,202
I miss you too.

510
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:32,419
When I look at the moons,

511
00:45:32,768 --> 00:45:35,979
I wish that we can be together just like them.

512
00:45:38,721 --> 00:45:42,019
Phone, are you looking at the moon?

513
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:43,955
Yes.

514
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:47,979
How many moons are in the sky?

515
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:51,456
You are talking strangely.

516
00:45:52,173 --> 00:45:54,019
Of course, there are two moons.

517
00:45:58,725 --> 00:46:00,746
If my theory is right,

518
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:06,020
It's possible that I was contacting the past of the parallel world.

519
00:46:06,733 --> 00:46:10,819
Dome that you are looking for may be in another universe.

520
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:15,617
Multiverse.

521
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,420
Yes.

522
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:26,798
Multiverse theory believes that there are other universes besides ours.

523
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:28,779
I heard of it before.

524
00:46:29,362 --> 00:46:32,237
I watched the Marvel films.

525
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:33,577
I'm not that old.

526
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:37,912
How can you be sure that these universes are co-existing?

527
00:46:38,354 --> 00:46:43,611
The artifacts in this zone always play on human desires.

528
00:46:43,611 --> 00:46:47,445
The payphone may just tell you what you want to hear.

529
00:46:47,445 --> 00:46:49,851
Just like other people who used it.

530
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:53,051
I believe that the payphone can connect us

531
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,632
to the past of the other universe.

532
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,579
Otherwise, I wouldn't be standing here.

533
00:46:58,244 --> 00:47:00,450
If I didn't call Phone that day

534
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:03,380
and asked him to tell my past self to follow the signal.

535
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,844
I would never find the payphone or meet you on that day.

536
00:47:11,164 --> 00:47:13,219
From my speculation,

537
00:47:13,802 --> 00:47:16,780
I believe that there are three universes co-existing.

538
00:47:17,829 --> 00:47:20,419
No matter how hard I tried to save Phone's life,

539
00:47:20,933 --> 00:47:23,539
It always ended with his accident at a construction site,

540
00:47:25,063 --> 00:47:26,379
his drowning,

541
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,780
or his car accident.

542
00:47:31,342 --> 00:47:33,579
Three universes.

543
00:47:34,448 --> 00:47:35,508
Dome.

544
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:43,179
Chan.

545
00:47:46,783 --> 00:47:47,976
The One.

546
00:47:47,976 --> 00:47:49,219
Khatha.

547
00:47:53,877 --> 00:47:56,994
This means that Dome may be stuck in

548
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:58,555
the universe that Phone was drowned,

549
00:47:58,555 --> 00:47:59,869
Or the universe that Phone was killed

550
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:01,761
in an accident at a construction site.

551
00:48:02,493 --> 00:48:06,019
What did Dome say when he called you earlier today?

552
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,579
I'm stuck in the Limbo.

553
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:11,979
Limbo.

554
00:48:17,263 --> 00:48:18,690
Limbo.

555
00:48:19,195 --> 00:48:21,579
It was mentioned in many religions.

556
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,980
It's the bordering place between the world and hell

557
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:25,957
Some people believe that it is a place

558
00:48:25,982 --> 00:48:27,644
located on the way to the afterlife.

559
00:48:27,786 --> 00:48:31,182
I think it's mainly a place between rifts.

560
00:48:33,317 --> 00:48:35,456
How can we bring Dome back?

561
00:48:37,502 --> 00:48:39,650
I believe that the payphone has a signal generator

562
00:48:39,675 --> 00:48:42,043
that can connect different universes.

563
00:48:42,197 --> 00:48:44,419
If I can find and control it,

564
00:48:44,736 --> 00:48:47,979
I can use it to open the door to another universe to bring him back.

565
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:55,179
It means that I need to dissect this payphone.

566
00:49:11,051 --> 00:49:12,407
Where are you?

567
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,888
Do you want me to go see you?

568
00:49:17,183 --> 00:49:19,376
Good night. Bye.

569
00:49:21,213 --> 00:49:24,757
I wish that we can be together just like the moons.

570
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:57,579
2,600,072.

571
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,407
2,600,073.

572
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,477
Are you awake?

573
00:50:02,477 --> 00:50:04,066
2,600,074.

574
00:50:04,091 --> 00:50:07,210
How long have I slept?

575
00:50:09,727 --> 00:50:10,819
I don't know.

576
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,219
I'm busy counting the stars.

577
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:17,453
2,600,075.

578
00:50:19,924 --> 00:50:21,579
Go away.

579
00:50:22,343 --> 00:50:24,111
2,600,078.

580
00:50:24,111 --> 00:50:26,044
Can you stop counting the stars?

581
00:50:26,044 --> 00:50:27,617
2,600,080.

582
00:50:36,983 --> 00:50:38,379
Sure.

583
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:43,180
Then I'll count the moon.

584
00:50:44,546 --> 00:50:45,577
One.

585
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:48,605
Done.

586
00:51:17,327 --> 00:51:19,179
Earlier,

587
00:51:20,164 --> 00:51:21,580
What did you do?

588
00:51:24,272 --> 00:51:25,838
Do it again.

589
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:34,820
Wow!

590
00:51:55,555 --> 00:51:56,762
You...

591
00:51:56,762 --> 00:51:58,819
You can control the time here, can't you?

592
00:52:02,918 --> 00:52:04,256
That's cool.

593
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:23,400
Dome.

594
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,066
Dome, what are you doing?

595
00:52:27,066 --> 00:52:28,071
Dome.

596
00:52:28,071 --> 00:52:29,666
I want to know the future.

597
00:52:29,666 --> 00:52:31,837
I want to know how everything is going to end.

598
00:52:31,942 --> 00:52:32,909
Huh?

599
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:56,419
Mr. Khatha.

600
00:52:56,419 --> 00:52:57,488
It's ready.

601
00:52:57,488 --> 00:52:59,035
You can bring Dome's body here.

602
00:52:59,035 --> 00:53:00,091
We don't have much time.

603
00:53:00,091 --> 00:53:01,220
Okay.

604
00:53:25,671 --> 00:53:26,531
Tum.

605
00:53:28,118 --> 00:53:29,506
Dome is missing.

606
00:53:53,478 --> 00:53:54,762
Mr. Khatha, we don't have much time.

607
00:53:54,762 --> 00:53:56,422
I need to turn on the machine now.

608
00:54:05,306 --> 00:54:07,179
Turn it on.

609
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:39,580
Dome.

610
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,780
Go.

611
00:54:47,146 --> 00:54:48,019
Hurry up.

612
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:57,617
I'm leaving.

613
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:17,980
Dome.

614
00:55:23,082 --> 00:55:24,017
Tum.

615
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:26,419
Did Dome come back?

616
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:29,976
I'm not sure.

617
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,416
Help me.

618
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:53,693
Dome.

619
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,832
Help me.

620
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,918
Help me.

621
00:55:58,112 --> 00:55:59,317
I'm in here.

622
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:00,459
Help me.

Midnight Museum: The Payphone

627
00:56:53,091 --> 00:56:54,082
What happened?

628
00:56:54,082 --> 00:56:55,902
Why is Dome stuck in there?

629
00:56:55,902 --> 00:56:58,779
The most important thing right now is that we need to find Dome's body.

630
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:00,505
I saw Dome taken here.

631
00:57:00,778 --> 00:57:04,285
I think they are holding a ceremony to sacrifice children

632
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:07,220
to revive the thing that they believe to be their God.

633
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,383
Please let me be the one who revives you.
